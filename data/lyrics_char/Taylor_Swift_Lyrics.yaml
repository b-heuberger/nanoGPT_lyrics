Taylor Swift:
  '...Ready for It?': '[Verse 1]

    Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him

    Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted

    But if he''s a ghost, then I can be a phantom

    Holdin'' him for ransom, some

    Some boys are tryin'' too hard, he don''t try at all, though

    Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so

    I see nothin'' better, I keep him forever

    Like a vendetta-ta


    [Pre-Chorus]

    I, I, I see how this is gon'' go

    Touch me and you''ll never be alone

    I-Island breeze and lights down low

    No one has to know


    [Chorus]

    In the middle of the night, in my dreams

    You should see the things we do, baby, mmm

    In the middle of the night, in my dreams

    I know I''m gonna be with you, so I take my time

    Are you ready for it?


    [Verse 2]

    Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me

    Stealin'' hearts and runnin'' off and never sayin'' sorry

    But if I''m a thief, then he can join the heist and

    We''ll move to an island and

    And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor

    Every love I''ve known in comparison is a failure

    I forget their names now, I''m so very tame now

    Never be the same now, now

  30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30: "According to my birth certificate, I turn\
    \ 30 this year. It's weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels\
    \ 283, but the actual age I currently am is 29. I've heard people say that your\
    \ thirties are \"the most fun!\" So I'll definitely keep you posted on my findings\
    \ on that when I know. But until then, I thought I'd share some lessons I've learned\
    \ before reaching 30, because it's 2019 and sharing is caring.\n\nLesson 1\n\n\
    I learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also\
    \ inundate your brain with images of what you aren't, how you're failing, or who\
    \ is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen\
    \ this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments\
    \ off on my posts. That way, I'm showing my friends and fans updates on my life,\
    \ but I'm training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that\
    \ I look \U0001F525\U0001F525\U0001F525. I'm also blocking out anyone who might\
    \ feel the need to tell me to \"go die in a hole ho\" while I'm having my coffee\
    \ at nine in the morning. I think it's healthy for your self-esteem to need less\
    \ internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could\
    \ unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit\
    \ by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment\
    \ I received once.\n\nLesson 2\nBeing sweet to everyone all the time can get you\
    \ into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a\
    \ polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life's worst regrets\
    \ if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your\
    \ gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake\u2014only bite if someone\
    \ steps on you.\n\nLesson 3\nTrying and failing and trying again and failing again\
    \ is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures\
    \ are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown\
    \ culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID,\
    \ it's good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It's especially good\
    \ to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That's GOOD. We'll always\
    \ be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing\
    \ at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That's\
    \ not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you'll learn from it. Then you'll\
    \ probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it's fine; do you,\
    \ you're searching.\n\nLesson 4\nI learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on\
    \ my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means\
    \ curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries\
    \ of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick\
    \ fix. I work on accepting my body every day.\n\nLesson 5\n\nBanish the drama.\
    \ You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those\
    \ in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you,\
    \ or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number\
    \ isn't cruel. It's just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama\
    \ if you so choose to use it.\n\nLesson 6\n\nI've learned that society is constantly\
    \ sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging\
    \ is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we\
    \ aren't allowed to age. It's an impossible standard to meet, and I've been loving\
    \ how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels\
    \ like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling\
    \ women we're supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order\
    \ to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn't even remotely required\
    \ of men.\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $197Lesson 7\n\nMy biggest\
    \ fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was\
    \ completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were\
    \ going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous\
    \ amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear\
    \ of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade\
    \ bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids\
    \ have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I've ever had online.\
    \ You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start\
    \ prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the\
    \ world, the love I've witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to\
    \ live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by\
    \ our greatest fears.\nLesson 8\n\nI learned not to let outside opinions establish\
    \ the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions\
    \ of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general\
    \ internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was \"\
    couples goals\" based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn't real.\
    \ For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to\
    \ have my OWN value system of what I actually want.\n\nLesson 9\nI learned how\
    \ to make some easy cocktails like Pimm's cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds,\
    \ and Mojitos because\u20262016.\nLesson 10\nI've always cooked a LOT, but I found\
    \ three recipes I know I'll be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Garten's\
    \ Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground\
    \ beef for meat), Nigella Lawson's Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver's Chicken\
    \ Fajitas with Mol\xE9 Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer.\
    \ I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head.\
    \ (Which is what I'm pretty sure the internet would call a \"weird flex.\")\n\
    Lesson 11\n\nRecently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer\
    \ holes in my walls if I'd hung things that way all along. This is not an ad.\
    \ I just really love Command tape.\n\nLesson 12\nApologizing when you have hurt\
    \ someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was\
    \ unintentional, it's so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say \"\
    I'm sorry, but...\" and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere\
    \ apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships.\n\
    Lesson 13\nIt's my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim.\
    \ Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual\
    \ assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because\
    \ I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand\
    \ and saying \"This happened to me.\" It's something no one would choose for themselves.\
    \ We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone\
    \ else if we don't.\nLesson 14\n\nWhen tragedy strikes someone you know in a way\
    \ you've never dealt with before, it's okay to say that you don't know what to\
    \ say. Sometimes just saying you're so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It's\
    \ okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don't have all the answers.\
    \ However, it's not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your\
    \ support is all someone needs when they're at their lowest point. Even if you\
    \ can't really help the situation, it's nice for them to know that you would if\
    \ you could.\n\nLesson 15\n\nVitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine,\
    \ which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium\
    \ for muscle health and energy.\n\nLesson 16\nBefore you jump in headfirst, maybe,\
    \ I don't know...get to know someone! All that glitters isn't gold, and first\
    \ impressions actually aren't everything. It's impressive when someone can charm\
    \ people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about\
    \ a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a \"solid\
    \ first 15\"), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest,\
    \ self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show\
    \ up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after they've seen you\
    \ broken? Or after they've walked in on you having a full conversation with your\
    \ cats as if they're people? These are things a first impression could never convey.\n\
    \nLesson 17\nAfter my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and\
    \ occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed\
    \ to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put\
    \ on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because,\
    \ why can't I be soft during all the seasons?!\n\nLesson 18\n\nRealizing childhood\
    \ scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a\
    \ kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring\
    \ flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or\
    \ trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself\
    \ surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops,\
    \ posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without\
    \ realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone.\
    \ It's important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living\
    \ embodiment of them.\n\nLesson 19\n\nPlaying mind games is for the chase. In\
    \ a real relationship or friendship, you're shooting yourself in the foot if you\
    \ don't tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it.\
    \ No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize\
    \ how you feel. This is real life, not chess.\nLesson 20\n\nLearning the difference\
    \ between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about \"we're in\
    \ our young twenties!\" hurls people together into groups that can feel like your\
    \ chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they'll\
    \ just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It's sad but\
    \ sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships\
    \ along the way, but you'll always keep the memories.\n\nLesson 21\n\nFashion\
    \ is all about playful experimentation. If you don't look back at pictures of\
    \ some of your old looks and cringe, you're doing it wrong. See: Bleachella.\n\
    Lesson 22\nHow to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you're not trying\
    \ to hurt the person you love and they aren't trying to hurt you. If you can wind\
    \ the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person\
    \ is coming from, there's a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing\
    \ a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who \"won\" the fight. I\
    \ know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say \"Hey, same team.\" Find a way\
    \ to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of\
    \ the good things you two have built. They don't give out awards for winning the\
    \ most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers.\n\nLesson\
    \ 23\nI learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don't care if I'm\
    \ #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they're here now. The fans\
    \ and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled\
    \ me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was\
    \ knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back\
    \ up. I'll never forget the ones who stuck around.\nLesson 24\n\nI've had to learn\
    \ how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer,\
    \ and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It's taught me that there\
    \ are real problems and then there's everything else. My mom's cancer is a real\
    \ problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my\
    \ worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now.\nLesson 25\n\nI remember people\
    \ asking me, \"What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy?\" There's\
    \ a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good\
    \ art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I'm really grateful to have learned\
    \ this isn't true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been\
    \ really cool.\n\nLesson 26\nI make countdowns for things I'm excited about. When\
    \ I've gone through dark, low times, I've always found a tiny bit of relief and\
    \ hope in getting a countdown app (they're free) and adding things I'm looking\
    \ forward to. Even if they're not big holidays or anything, it's good to look\
    \ toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it's good\
    \ to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things.\n\nLesson\
    \ 27\nI learned that disarming someone's petty bullying can be as simple as learning\
    \ to laugh. In my experience, I've come to see that bullies want to be feared\
    \ and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign\
    \ by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on\
    \ board with it led me to feeling lower than I've ever felt in my life, but I\
    \ can't tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable\
    \ cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. It's the\
    \ Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll's hateful Instagram comment\
    \ with \"lol.\" It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully\
    \ us, but maybe all I'll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive\
    \ it, and thrive in spite of it.\n\nLesson 28\n\nI'm finding my voice in terms\
    \ of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and\
    \ the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day\
    \ life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and\
    \ felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching\
    \ 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers.\
    \ Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what\
    \ I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility\
    \ to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I'm going to do more to\
    \ help. We have a big race coming up next year.\n\nLesson 29\n\nI learned that\
    \ your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair\
    \ and now it is STRAIGHT. It's the straight hair I wished for every day in junior\
    \ high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they've left me.\
    \ Please pray for their safe return.\n\nLesson 30\n\nMy mom always tells me that\
    \ when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because\
    \ I would punish myself even worse. I'd lock myself in my room and couldn't forgive\
    \ myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel\
    \ I've made a mistake, whether it's self-imposed exile or silencing myself and\
    \ isolating. I've come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself\
    \ for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling\
    \ on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go.1"
  A Little More Like You: '[Verse 1]

    Think of something you can''t touch

    I see angels start to blush when they look at you

    When I went to my guitar to write this song I fell apart

    ''Cause I''m counting every second like time in a jar

    And these words are just words, that''s not what you are


    [Chorus]

    Would you rather me say what I really mean?

    I love you but it won''t get through if I try too hard

    Honestly, what I really mean

    Is I want to be a little more like you


    [Verse 2]

    Drag a pen across a page

    Take a look at what you made- you made me, me

    Turn around and watch me live

    Learn again that to forgive is to believe

    And to thank is to bless

    I''m drawing the curtain, ''cause now I''ve been blessed


    [Chorus]

    Would you rather me say what I really mean?

    I love you but it won''t get through if I try too hard

  A Message From Taylor: 'Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heart-broken person

    It was all over the place

    A fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end

    Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild

    And tortured by memories past

    These are the original thirty songs that were meant for Red

  A Monster In My Closet!: 'There''s a monster in my closet and I don''t know what

    Have you ever seen him?

    Has he ever pounced on you?

    I wonder what he looks like!

    Is he purple with red eyes?

    I wonder what he likes to eat.

    What about his size!!

    Tonight I''m gonna catch him!

    I''ll set a real big trap!

    Then I''ll train him really well.

    He''ll answer when I clap!


    When I looked up in that closet, there was nothing there but stuff.

    I know that monster''s in there!

    I heard him huff and puff!

    Could it be he wants to eat me?

    Maybe I''m his favorite tray.

    And if he comes to get me,

    I''ll scream loudly, "Go away!!"

    If he''s nice, I''ll name him "Happy."

    If he''s bad I''ll name him "Grouch."

    I suspect that he is leaving, but if not. . .I''ll kick him out!See Taylor Swift

  All Night Diner: '[Verse 1]

    I wake up

    I stretch out

    I wonder what you''re doin'' right now

    Yeah I slept, in my makeup again

    Tell myself ''I must be crazy''

    Thinkin'' ''bout him

    I find myself something decent to wear

    Take the towel out of my hair

    About that time, you call me

    And I''m reminded, without you

    I''d be a stranger in an all night diner

    Waiting for a love to find her

    Lonely like a harbor light

    I go to work

  Am I Ready for Love: '[Verse 1]

    Sometimes I wonder how it''s going to feel

    Will my first love be true and real?

    Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?

    What will I do when my love comes to call?

    And my daddy tells me that I light up his world

    Everyday he says, darling you''re my best girl

    He tried to teach me from the very start

    The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart


    [Chorus]

    Will my love come in a bowl of fire?

    Will it be filled with hope and desire?

    Will my love come in a pouring rain?

    Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

    I know I''m not a little girl anymore

    Cause I''m feeling things I''ve never felt before

    Sweet sensations and anticipations

    Calling commotion to my emotions

    And I hear the words my daddy said to me

    He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free

  Being with My Baby: '[Verse 1]

    All is quiet in the world tonight

    Counting stars and fireflies

    And summer sings a lullaby

    With me and my baby

    On the hood of his daddy''s car

    We ass around his old guitar

    Bet mama''s wondering where we are

    It''s just me and my baby


    [Pre-Chorus]

    The world is spinning round

    Cause look just what I''ve found


    [Chorus]

    Ooh, life''s so sweet right here

    Ooh, keeping it young and crazy

    Ooh, just want to stay right here

    Cause nothing''s quite like being with my baby


    [Verse 2]

    Driving home by the river side

    Wishing I could slow down time

    And take a picture with my mind

    Of me and my baby

    The car pulls up and I''m home too late

    We didn''t take that interstate

    That back road was a better way

    For me and my baby

  Better Off: '[Verse 1]

    I live down the street in a broken down house

    And a car up on blocks in the driveway

    The moment we meet, there was never a doubt

    That we won''t forget this Sunday

    It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles

    And it all leads to this - our first kiss


    [Chorus]

    All my friends are saying

    Girl, what are you thinking?

    You''re better off

    You''re better off without him

    Find yourself another

    Girl, that boy is trouble

    You''re better off, you''re better off

    They can talk forever, they just don''t know better


    [Verse 2]

    We drive around town in a rusty old truck

    But somehow it feels like we''re flying

    Don''t want to come down

    But they make it so tough

    Cause everyone we know is trying

    To push us apart, hide it down in our hearts

    And they get what they want cause you''re gone

  Better Than Revenge: '[Intro]

    Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)

    Haha, time for a little revenge


    [Verse 1]

    The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and

    I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him

    She came along, got him alone, and let''s hear the applause

    She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"

    I never saw it coming, wouldn''t have suspected it

    I underestimated just who I was dealing with

    She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum

    She underestimated just who she was stealing from


    [Chorus]

    She''s not a saint and she''s not what you think

    She''s an actress, woah

    She''s better known for the things that she does

    On the mattress, woah

    Soon, she''s gonna find stealing other people''s toys

    On the playground won''t make you many friends

    She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind

    There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha


    [Verse 2]

    She looks at life like it''s a party and she''s on the list

    She looks at me like I''m a trend and she''s so over it

    I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and

    She thinks I''m psycho ''cause I like to rhyme her name with things

    But sophistication isn''t what you wear or who you know

    Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go

    Oh, they didn''t teach you that in prep school so it''s up to me

    But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

    (Think about what you did)

    [Bridge]

    I''m just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey

    You might have him, but haven''t you heard?

    I''m just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey

    You might have him, but I always get the last word

    Woah, woah-ah-oh


    [Chorus]

    She''s not a saint and she''s not what you think

    She''s an actress, woah (She deserved it)

    She''s better known for the things that she does

    On the mattress, woah

    On the playground won''t make you many friends

    And I know you heard about me

    I want you bad, but it''s come down to nothing

    And all I have is your sympathy

    ''Cause you took me home but you just couldn''t keep me

    Bye, bye, baby

    Bye, bye, baby


    [Verse 2]

    The picture frame is empty

    On the dresser, vacant just like me

    I see your writing on the dash

    Then back to your hesitation

    I was so sure of everything

    Everything I thought we''d always have

    Guess I never doubted it

    Then the here and the now floods in

    Feels like I''m becoming a part of your past

    (Once, I had an empire)


    [Verse 1: Taylor Swift]

    Once, I had an empire in a golden age

    I was held up so high, I used to be great

    They used to cheer when they saw my face

    Now, I fear I have fallen from grace


    [Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]

    And I feel like my castle''s crumbling down

    And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground

    And you don''t want to know me, I will just let you down

    You don''t wanna know me now


    [Verse 2: Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]

    Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty

    Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me

    Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far

    I held that grudge ''til it tore me apart


    [Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift]

    Power went to my head and I couldn''t stop

    Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off

    And here I sit alone behind walls of regret

    Falling down like promises that I never kept

  Cold as You: '[Verse 1]

    You have a way of coming easily to me

    And when you take, you take the very best of me

    So I start a fight ''cause I need to feel something

    And you do what you want ''cause I''m not what you wanted


    [Chorus]

    Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending

    Given to a perfect day

    Just walk away, ain''t no use defending

    Words that you will never say

    And now that I''m sitting here thinking it through

    I''ve never been anywhere cold as you


    [Verse 2]

    You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray

    And I stood there loving you and wished them all away

    And you come away with a great little story

    Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

    Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending

    Given to a perfect day

    Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending

  Dark Blue Tennessee: '[Verse 1]

  Daylight: '[Verse 1]

    My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in

    Everyone looked worse in the light

    There are so many lines that I''ve crossed unforgiven

    I''ll tell you the truth but never goodbye


    [Chorus]

    I don''t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

    I don''t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

    I''ve been sleepin'' so long in a twenty-year dark night

    And now I see daylight, I only see daylight


    [Verse 2]

    Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky

    And so I became the butt of the joke

    I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked

    Clearin'' the air, I breathed in the smoke


    [Pre-Chorus]

    Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down

    Maybe I''ve stormed out of every single room in this town

    Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it''s morning now

    It''s brighter now, now


    [Chorus]

    I don''t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

    (I can never look away)

    I don''t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

  Dear John: '[Verse 1]

    Long were the nights when

    My days once revolved around you

    Counting my footsteps

    Praying the floor won''t fall through again

    And my mother accused me of losing my mind

    But I swore I was fine

    You paint me a blue sky

    Then go back and turn it to rain

    And I lived in your chess game

    But you changed the rules everyday

    Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight

    Well, I stopped pickin'' up and this song is to let you know why


    [Chorus]

    Dear John, I see it all now that you''re gone

    Don''t you think I was too young to be messed with?

    The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

    I should''ve known


    [Verse 2]

    Well, maybe it''s me

    And my blind optimism to blame

    Or maybe it''s you and your sick need

    To give love and take it away

    And you''ll add my name to your long list of traitors

    Who don''t understand

    And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said

    "Run as fast as you can"

  "Don\u2019t Hate Me for Loving You": '[Verse 1]

    My momma stood across the room

    Face to face but never eye to eye

    Recalling words we said

    The battle that we swore

    We''d never fight

    Breaking pieces off with every lie

    A tear came to her eye

    And she said


    [Chorus]

    Don''t walk away now

    And don''t rip my heart out

    Don''t you block me out tonight

    Honey where are you?

    And don''t hate me for loving you


    [Verse 2]

    He walked around my life

    And made blind

    With every single move

    He caught me staring at him

    Mad about him

    Little that I knew

    I slammed the door

    Sat on the floor

    Cried into my bed

    Said are you there?

    But someone said

  Drive (For Daddy Gene): '[Verse 1]

    It was painted red, the stripe was white

    It was 18 feet from bow to stern light

    Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta

    I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her

    We put on a shine, put on a motor

    Built out of love, and made for the water

    Ran her for years, until the transom got rotten

    A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten


    [Chorus]

    It was just an old plywood boat

    75 Johnson and an electric choke

    A young girl, two hands on the wheel

    I can''t replace the way it made me feel

    And I would turn her sharp

    I would make it whine

    He''d say, "You can''t beat the way a old wood boat rides"

    Just a little lake across the Alabama line

    But I was king of the ocean

    When Daddy let me drive


    [Verse 2]

    Just an old half ton short bed Ford

    My uncle bought new in ''64

    Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking

    A couple burnt valves and he had it going

    He''d let me drive her when we haul off a load

    Down a dirt strip, we''d haul trash off of Thigpen Road

    I''d sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals

    Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

    It was just an old hand-me-down Ford

    With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door

    A young girl, two hands on the wheel

    I can''t replace the way it made me feel and

    I would press that clutch

    And I would keep it right

    He would say a little slower, girl

    You''re doing just fine

    Just a dirt road with trash on each side

    But I was Mario Andretti

    When Daddy let me drive


    [Bridge]

    Soon I''ll be grown up

    With daughters of my own

    I let them drive my old jeep

    Across the pasture at our home

    Maybe one day they''ll reach back in their file

    And pull out that old memory

    And think of me and smile

    And say


    [Chorus]

    It was just an old worn out jeep

    Rusty old floor boards

    Hot on my feet

    A young girl, two hands on the wheel

    I can''t replace the way it made me feel

    And he''d say

    Steer it left, and turn it right

    Straighten up girl now, you''re doing just fine

    Just a little valley by the river where we''d ride

    But I was high on a mountain

    When Daddy let me drive

    Oh, he let me drive

    Oh, he let me drive

  Fifteen: '[Verse 1]

    You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors

    It''s the mornin'' of your very first day

    You say "hi" to your friends you ain''t seen in a while

    Try and stay out of everybody''s way

    It''s your freshman year and you''re gonna be here

    For the next four years in this town

    Hopin'' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say

    "You know, I haven''t seen you around before"


    [Chorus]

    ''Cause when you''re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you

    You''re gonna believe them

    And when you''re fifteen, feelin'' like there''s nothin'' to figure out

    Well, count to ten, take it in

    This is life before you know who you''re gonna be

    Fifteen


    [Verse 2]

    You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail

    And soon enough, you''re best friends

    Laughin'' at the other girls who think they''re so cool

    We''ll be outta here as soon as we can

    And then, you''re on your very first date and he''s got a car

    And you''re feelin'' like flyin''

    Dating the boy on the football team

    But I didn''t know it at fifteen


    [Bridge]

    When all you wanted was to be wanted

    Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

    Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday

    But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

    And Abigail gave everything she had

    To a boy who changed his mind

    And we both cried


    [Chorus]

    ''Cause when you''re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you

    You''re gonna believe them

    Forever winter if you go

    I''d take that bomb in your head and disarm it

    I''d say, "I love you even at your darkest and

    Please, don''t go"

    Took off faster than a green light, go

    Never looking down

    And right there where we stood

    Was holy ground

    Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress

    We had this big wide city all to ourselves

    We blocked the noise with the sound of, "I need you"

  How To Save A Life: '[Verse 1]

    Step one, you say, "We need to talk."

    He walks, you say, "Sit down. It''s just a talk."

    He smiles politely back at you

    You stare politely right on through

    Some sort of window to your right

    As he goes left and you stay right

    Between the lines of fear and blame

    You begin to wonder why you came


    [Chorus]

    Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend

    Somewhere along in the bitterness

    And I would have stayed up with you all night

    Had I known how to save a life


    [Verse 2]

    Let him know that you know best

    ''Cause after all you do know best

    Try to slip past his defense

    Without granting innocence

    Lay down a list of what is wrong

    The things you''ve told him all along

    Pray to God, he hears you

    And I pray to God, he hears you

    And I would have stayed up with you all night

    Had I known how to save a life


    [Verse 3]

    As he begins to raise his voice

    You lower yours and grant him one last choice

    Drive until you lose the road

    Or break with the ones you''ve followed

    He will do one of two things

    He will admit to everything

    Or he''ll say he''s just not the same

    And you''ll begin to wonder why you came

    And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree

    And I''ll bet your friends tell you she''s better than me, huh


    [Verse 2: Taylor Swift]

    Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles

    Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love

    Oh, they sit around talkin'' about the meaning of life

    And the book that just saved ''em that I hadn''t heard of

    I bet you couldn''t believe

    When you realized I''m harder to forget than I was to leave

    And I bet you think about me


    [Verse 3: Taylor Swift]

    You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community

    Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills

    I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn''t a mansion

    Just livin'' room dancin'' and kitchen table bills


    [Verse 4: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]

    But you know what they say, you can''t help who you fall for

    And you and I fell like an early spring snow

    And I guess I wished on a plane

    That I thought was a star


    [Verse 2]

    Diving off into the deep end

    Honestly believed you''d be there

    When I jumped in

    Guess it ain''t your territory

  If This Was a Movie: '[Verse 1]

    Last night, I heard my own heart beating

    Sounded like footsteps on my stairs

    Six months gone and I''m still reaching

    Even though I know you''re not there

    Thinking ''bout everything we''ve been through

    Maybe I''ve been going back too much lately

    But I remember how it was back then

    Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin''

    ''Cause nothing like this ever happened to them

    Now I''m pacing down the hall, chasing down your street

    Flashback to the night when you said to me

  "If You\u2019re Anything Like Me [Poem]": 'If you''re anything like me,

    You bite your nails,

    And laugh when you''re nervous.

    You promise people the world,

    because that''s what they want from you.

    You like giving them what they want...

    But darling, you need to stop,


    If you''re anything like me,

    You knock on wood every time you make plans.

    You cross your fingers, hold your breath,

    Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes

    Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.

    Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...

    If life gets too good now,

    Darling, it scares you.

    If you''re anything like me,

    You never wanted to lock your door,

    Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer

    Didn''t want to face the you you don''t know anymore

    For fear she was much better before...

    But Darling, now you have to.


    If you''re anything like me,

    There''s a justice system in your head

    For names you''ll never speak again,

    And you make your ruthless rulings.

    Each new enemy turns to steel

    They become the bars that confine you,

    In your own little golden prison cell...

    But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.

    See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $197If you''re anything like me

    You''ve grown to hate your pride

    To love your thighs

    And no amount of friends at 25

    Will fill the empty seats

    At the lunch tables of your past

    The teams that picked you last...

    But Darling, you keep trying.


    If you''re anything like me,

    You couldn''t recognize the face of your love

    Until they stripped you of your shiny paint

    Threw your victory flag away

    And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...

    Darling, later on you will thank your stars

    for that frightful day.


    If you''re anything like me,

    I''m sorry.


    But Darling, it''s going to be okay.24'

  Kid in the Crowd: '[Verse 1]

    Little girl, she looks around

    She''s standing in the open ground

    Looks up at the girl alone singing through the microphone

    Girl gives girl a little smile

    And just one wink that could have run a mile

    But life is full of empty days

    But the little girl said, "I''m gonna be like that someday"


    [Chorus]

    I, I remember the eyes

    Of the kid in the crowd

    Who cut me down to size

    And realizing is crying out loud

    For every kid on stage

    There is a kid in the crowd


    [Verse 2]

    Girl on stage holds her hand

    Backed up by a country band

    Looking down with eyes of grace

    Looked upon that young girl''s face

    And when she smiled at that eight-year-old

    Endless thoughts that can never be told

    Wiped away those empty days

    And the little girl said, "I''m gonna be like that someday"

  Long Time Going: '[Verse 1]

    I got a lying smile I never put out for you

    ''Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to

    And they say little girls have big dreams

    And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you


    [Chorus]

    And it was a long time coming

    I waited half my life just to find someone like you

    I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out

    Not knowing it''d be a long time going


    [Verse 2]

    They say it''s better to have lost than never to have loved at all

    And I say, whoever said that didn''t have too far to fall

    And they say little girls are so naive

    That wasn''t how it was supposed to be with me and you


    [Chorus]

    And it was a long time coming

    I waited half my life just to find someone like you

    I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out

    Not knowing it will be a long time going


    [Bridge]

    I''ve burned my bridges, had sleepless nights

    Washed my sins on the neon lights

    And I''m still not over you

    And it will be a long time, long time going

  Lover: '[Verse 1]

    Can we always be this close?

    Forever and ever, ah

  Lover (Piano/Vocal): "[Spoken]\nWriting the song \"Lover\" was one of those magical\
    \ experiences that you sometimes get to\u2005have\u2005as a songwriter.\u2005\
    Um, I wrote it really quick\u2005in the middle of the night. As soon as I wrote\
    \ it, I knew I wanted it to be the album title. And I knew that writing it kinda\
    \ would depict the tone of the entire record. So it was a real catalyst for what\
    \ this album turned into. And I wrote it alone, so I wanted to go in and play\
    \ it for Jack Antonoff who I knew who would be the perfect person to produce it.\
    \ And so I walked into the studio and I sat in the piano. And this is what happened\
    \ So it is, it's basically, I don't see it as a piano. I think it's that like,\
    \ kinda of, dreamy, guitary, throwback, but not like camp throwback, so.\n\n[Sung:\

  Lover [Foreword]: "When I found old diaries from my childhood and my teens, they\
    \ were covered in\u2005dust.\u2005I'm not just\u2005saying that for poetic effect,\
    \ they\u2005were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits\
    \ and inspirational quotes I used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful\
    \ moments. I'd practice my autograph and tape my guitar picks to the pages. In\
    \ the entries, I daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the\
    \ dance or how nervous I was saying the national anthem at the local baseball\
    \ game. I frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love, friends, confidence\
    \ and trust. I vented, described memories in detail, jotted down new song ideas\
    \ and questioned why I would ever try to shoot for a career I had such a small\
    \ chance of ever attaining.\n\nBut what shocked me the most was how often I wrote\
    \ down the things I loved. Writing a new song, riding in the car with my mom,\
    \ the purple-pink skies of the soccer field  on the walk home, the one night in\
    \ middle school when none of my friends were fighting, the dazzle of opal necklaces\
    \ I couldn\u2019t afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case. I wrote\
    \ about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such...\
    \ wonderment. Intrigue. Romance. I noticed things and decided they were romantic,\
    \ and so they were.\n\nIn life, we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities\
    \ of trying to figure out who to be, how to act, or how to be happy. Like invisible\
    \ smoke in the room, we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what\
    \ kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life. We constantly question our\
    \ choices, our surroundings, and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes. All the\
    \ while, we crave romance. We long for those rare, enchanting moments when things\
    \ just fall into place. Above all else, we really, really want our lives to be\
    \ filled with love.\n\nI've decided that in this life, I want to be defined by\
    \ the things I love- not the things I hate, the things I'm afraid of, or the things\
    \ that haunt me in the middle of the night. Those things may be struggles, but\
    \ they're not my identity. I wish the same for you. May your struggles become\
    \ inaudible background noise behind the loud, clear voices of those who love and\
    \ appreciate you. Turn those voices up in the mix in your head. May you take notice\
    \ of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even\
    \ find wonderment in them. May you write down your feelings and reflect on them\
    \ years later, only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might\
    \ kill you... didn't. I hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed. I\
    \ hope that if there is a lover in your life, it's someone who deserves you. If\
    \ that's the case, I hope you treat them with care.\n\nThis album is a love letter\
    \ to love itself- all the captivating, spellbinding, maddening devastating red,\
    \ blue, gray, golden aspects of it (that's why there are so many songs).\nIn honor\
    \ of fever dreams, bad boys, confessions of love on a drunken night out, Christmas\
    \ lights still hanging in January, guitar string scars on my hands, false gods\
    \ and blind faith, memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool, creaks in floorboards\
    \ and ultraviolet morning light, finally finding a friend, and opening the curtains\
    \ to see the clearest, brightest daylight after the darkest night.\nWe are what\
    \ we love.\nThis is Lover.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $197"
  Lucky You: '[Verse 1]

    There''s a little girl in this little town

    With a little too much heart to go around

    Live forever, never say never

    You could do better, that''s what she says


    [Chorus]

    Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night

    A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite

    Of the fact that she''s different

    And yet she''s the same

    And she says, "Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

    Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do

    Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do

    Lucky you, lucky you"


    [Verse 2]

    She sings her little song, she walks along

    A little pathway headed for the skies

    Left to travels, lives they unravel

    Mind over matter, that''s what she says


    [Chorus]

    Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night

    A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite

    Of the fact that she''s different

    And yet she''s the same

    And she says, "Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

    He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain

    He wanted a bride, I was making my own name

    Chasing that fame, he stayed the same

    [Verse 1]

    My town was a wasteland

    Full of cages, full of fences

    Pageant queens and big pretenders

    But for some, it was paradise

    My boy was a montage

    A slow-motion, love potion

    Jumping off things in the ocean

    I broke his heart ''cause he was nice

    He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

    It came like a postcard

    Picture perfect shiny family

    Holiday peppermint candy

    But for him, it''s every day

    So I peered through a window

    A deep portal, time travel

    You were in college working part time waitin'' tables

    Left a small town, never looked back

    I was a flight risk with a fear of falling

    Wonderin'' why we bother with love if it never lasts


    [Pre-Chorus]

    I say, "Can you believe it?"

    As we''re lyin'' on the couch

    The moment I could see it

    Yes, yes, I can see it now


    [Chorus]

    Do you remember, we were sittin'' there by the water?

    You put your arm around me for the first time

    You made a rebel of a careless man''s careful daughter

    You are the best thing that''s ever been mine


    [Verse 2]

    Flash forward and we''re takin'' on the world together

    And there''s a drawer of my things at your place

    You learn my secrets and you figure out why I''m guarded

    You say we''ll never make my parents'' mistakes

    You put your arm around me for the first time

    You made a rebel of a careless man''s careful daughter

    You are the best thing that''s ever been mine

    And I remember that fight, 2:30AM

    As everything was slipping right out of our hands

    I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

    Braced myself for the goodbye

    ''Cause that''s all I''ve ever known

    Then you took me by surprise

    You said, "I''ll never leave you alone"

    [Chorus]

    You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water

    And every time I look at you, it''s like the first time

    I fell in love with a careless man''s careful daughter

    Now I''m feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress

    Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard

    And ran for my life (Ah)

  Never Grow Up: '[Verse 1]

    I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone


    [Verse 3]

    So, here I am in my new apartment

    In a big city, they just dropped me off

    It''s so much colder than I thought it would be

    So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

    [Chorus]

    Wish I''d never grown up

    I wish I''d never grown up

    Wish I''d never grown up, I could still be little

  Our Last Night: '[Verse 1]

    Oh

    We were standing in an empty room

    The moonlight was falling

    You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you

    And I could have spent a life with you

    But those days are over

    You were calling my name

    When your face faded from view


    [Pre-Chorus]

    Wasn''t it you that told me?

    The sun would always chase the day

    Wasn''t it you that told me?


    [Chorus]

    Angels fly, in the air tonight

    Saying wasn''t it just like swimming out on the lake?

    Stars collide in the air so light

    Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night


    [Verse 2]

    Oh

    I remember waking up with you

    The days doing nothing

    You meant more to me then, than you ever knew

    You were going to be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a Nobel seminar

    Hope the the world never tore that out of you

    Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?

    And the songs we played and the Indian days

    Whatever happened to the things you gave away?

    Like Harold and martin singing

    I was waving as you drove away

    The sunlight was falling

    You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane


    [Chorus]

    Angels fly in the air tonight

    Was it just like the promises that we made?

    And stars collide in the air so light

    Was it just like those promises that you made?

    I found that picture of you in that green dress

    He sure had a good time cleaning up that mess

    He found thirty other pieces but he''ll never find them all

  Rain Song: '[Verse 1]

    Just had a conversation with the mirror

    I ended up not having much to say

    Said "Today is for the lovers and the leaders

    I hate to tell you, it just ain''t your day"


    [Chorus]

    So this is my rain song

    It''s cold outside and I still love you

    Guess I was dead wrong

    You''ll find out when there''s clouds above you

    Finding it ain''t worth losing you

    When it all comes down

    It comes down to

    This only rain song

    You''re on my mind and I still love you


    [Verse 2]

    And it''s a complication with the voices

    Rounding all around inside my mind

    I used to think this heart had lots of choices

    But they all lead to your doorstep every time

    This is my rain song

    It''s cold outside and I still love you

    Guess I was dead wrong

    I had a conversation with the mirror

    It ended up not having much to say'
  Rare Peer (Brenda Lee Tribute): 'I''m curled up in my mother''s bed, staring intently
    at my laptop. I''m watching a video of a familiar-looking man wearing a black
    tuxedo. The video seems to be of a televised award show. The tape is grainy, but
    the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear:


    "Now I''m gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand. Her voice is full like
    solid gold, with some platinum blended in. Sometimes you''ll hear silver when
    she twists and twirls her notes... but gold is Brenda''s metal in this song I
    wish I''d wrote. Ladies and gentlemen... Brenda Lee."


    The camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties. The music starts, and
    she''s looking down at a framed picture. She''s at ease. She is theatrical. And
    she is beautiful, in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye. Lights,
    camera, action. She starts to sing. That''s when you hear the gold, and you watch
    her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand. The performance ends, and
    the crowd goes wild. The lovely lady graciously takes a bow. She smiles out into
    the vast darkness, taking it all in with grace and composure. The video ends,
    and I reflect back on what I just saw. It was a timeless performance, but here
    are the facts: The year is 1983. The song is "Someone Loves You Honey." The man
    in the tuxedo is Johnny Cash. And the woman in the beautiful dress with the honey-like
    voice is none other than Brenda Lee.


    Brenda Lee, who was born in 1944 near Atlanta and used her prodigious singing
    talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father. Brenda Lee,
    the little girl who took over the music world with chart-topping hits when she
    was still a child. Brenda Lee, the woman who ushered in a new style of rock &
    roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television.
    Brenda Lee, the artist who later went back to her country roots, proving that
    she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category
    her music fell under. Brenda Lee, the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak
    so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her.


    I watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause.
    There''s a reason she''s been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty
    years. Brenda Lee is grace. Brenda Lee is class and composure. And when she hears
    the roar of a crowd, Brenda Lee smiles like she''s five years old and receiving
    her first standing ovation. Brenda Lee is someone I will always look up to because
    of the way she shines. As Johnny Cash said in 1983, it''s almost like she''s golden.See

  Reputation Tour Book Intro: 'Here''s to the tour that taught me that your real friends
    really don''t care about the "he said/she said." Here''s to the moments when we''ve
    forgotten all about the things that scare us, the things we''re insecure about,
    and in spite of them, we jumped around together under flashing lights, fireworks,
    and confetti.


    To the times I learned, by watching you sing along to every song, that my greatest
    triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me. And that even in
    your worst times, they can see the best in you.


    Here''s to the musical family I get to share the stage with and all the things
    they''ve sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing, play, and dance as well
    as they do. Here''s to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from
    the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you. Here''s
    to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the
    floor after the party.

    Here''s to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time, but still remaining
    delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust, and brave enough to
    stay when it''s hard or it''s wrong or we''re making mistakes. Here''s to life
    teaching us lessons, and us learning, growing, dancing, and changing together.
    Everything I''ve learned about a "reputation" and how little it really means when
    defined by those who do not know you, I''ve learned from the fans whose spirits
    lit up these stadiums.

    Thanks to you, I''m doing better than I ever was.

    And time can''t stop me quite like you did

    And my flight was awful, thanks for asking

    I''m unglued, thanks to you

    And lead me up the staircase, won''t you whisper soft and slow?

    I''m captivated by you, baby, like a fireworks show


    [Chorus]

    Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain

    Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain

    ''Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

    Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down

    Give me something that''ll haunt me when you''re not around

    And the sparks fly

    Oh, baby, smile

  Speak Now: '[Verse 1]

    I am not the kind of girl

    Who should be rudely bargin'' in on a white veil occasion

    But you are not the kind of boy

    Who should be marrying the wrong girl

    I sneak in and see your friends

    And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel

    And she is yelling at a bridesmaid

    Somewhere back inside a room

    Wearin'' a gown shaped like a pastry


    [Pre-Chorus]

    This is surely not what you thought it would be

    I lose myself in a daydream

    Where I stand and say


    [Chorus]

    Don''t say yes, run away now

    I''ll meet you when you''re out

    Of the church, at the back door

    Don''t wait or say a single vow

    You need to hear me out

    And they said, "Speak now"


    [Verse 2]

    Fond gestures are exchanged

    And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march

    And I am hiding in the curtains

    It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

    I hear the preacher say

    "Speak now or forever hold your peace"

    There''s the silence, there''s my last chance

    I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me

    Horrified looks from everyone in the room

    But I''m only lookin'' at you

    Who should be rudely bargin'' in on a white veil occasion

    [Verse 2: Love Story]

    We were both young when I first saw you

    Close my eyes and the flashback starts

    I''m standing there on a balcony in summer air

    See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns

    See you make your way through the crowd

    And say, "Hello", little did I know?


    [Pre-Chorus 2: Love Story]

    That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

    And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"

    And I was crying on the staircase

    Begging you, please, don''t go

    And I said


    [Chorus 2: Love Story]

    "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone

    I''ll be waiting, all that''s left to do is run

    You''ll be the prince and I''ll be the princess

    [Bridge 1: Love Story]

    Oh, oh

    I got tired of waiting

    Wondering if you were ever coming around

    My faith in you was fading

    When I met you on the outskirts of town, I said

    [Breakdown: Love Story]

    "Romeo save me, I''ve been feeling so alone

    I keep waiting for you but you never come

    Is this in my head? I don''t know what to think"

    He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

    "Marry me, Juliet, you''ll never have to be alone

    I love you and that''s all I really know

    Think I know it''s with me

  "Suburban Legends (Taylor\u2019s Version) [From The Vault]": '[Verse 1]

    You had people who called you on unmarked numbers

    In my peripheral vision

    I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer

    All was quickly forgiven

    You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious

    Flush with the currency of cool

    I was always turnin'' out my empty pockets

    And when it came to you


    [Chorus]

    I didn''t come here to make friends

    We were born to be suburban legends

    When you hold me, it holds me together

    And you kiss me in a way that''s gonna screw me up forever


    [Verse 2]

    I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs

    Would surprise the whole school

    When I ended up back at our class reunion

    Walkin'' in with you

    You''d be more than a chapter in my old diaries

    With the pages ripped out

    And that''s what I learned from you


    [Verse 2]

    Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change

    Just like the two of us

    Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket

    Guess I loved you way too much

    But I''m a little smarter, my heart''s a little harder

    But it''s still soft enough to cry

    Cause I remember those times

    I remember

    Said, "It''s really been a while

  The Archer: '[Verse 1]

    Combat, I''m ready for combat

    I say I don''t want that, but what if I do?

    ''Cause cruelty wins in the movies

    I''ve got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you


    [Pre-Chorus]

    Easy they come, easy they go

    I jump from the train, I ride off alone

    I never grew up, it''s getting so old

    Help me hold on to you


    [Chorus]

    I''ve been the archer, I''ve been the prey

    Who could ever leave me, darling

    But who could stay?


    [Verse 2]

    Dark side, I search for your dark side

    But what if I''m alright, right, right, right here?

    And I cut off my nose just to spite my face

    Then I hate my reflection for years and years


    [Pre-Chorus]

    I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost

    The room is on fire, invisible smoke

    And all of my heroes die all alone

    All the king''s horses, all the king''s men

    Couldn''t put me together again

  The Best Day: '[Verse 1]

    I''m five years old, it''s getting cold, I''ve got my big coat on

    I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run

    Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides

    Look now, the sky is gold

    I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


    [Chorus]

    I don''t know why all the trees change in the fall

    But I know you''re not scared of anything at all

    Don''t know if Snow White''s house is near or far away

    But I know I had the best day with you today


    [Verse 2]

    I''m thirteen now

    And don''t know how my friends could be so mean

    I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

    And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away

    And we talk and window shop ''til I''ve forgotten all their names


    [Chorus]

    I don''t know who I''m going to talk to now at school

    But I know I''m laughing on the car ride home with you

    [Verse 3]

    There is a video I found from back when I was three

    You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you''re talking to me

    It''s the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs

    And Daddy''s smart

    And you''re the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

    I know you were on my side even when I was wrong

  The Future of Music Is a Love Story: "Where will the music industry be in 20 years,\
    \ 30 years, 50 years?\n\nBefore I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should\
    \ know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the\
    \ few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry\
    \ is not dying\u2026it's just coming alive\n\nThere are many (many) people who\
    \ predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic\
    \ entity. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will\
    \ continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into\
    \ a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place\
    \ on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Piracy, file sharing and\
    \ streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every\
    \ artist has handled this blow differently\n\nIn recent years, you've probably\
    \ read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically\
    \ give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for\
    \ the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet\u2026\
    is that they all realize their worth and ask for it\n\nMusic is art, and art is\
    \ important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should\
    \ be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction\
    \ is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's\
    \ price point is. I hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their\
    \ art\n\nArrows Through the Heart\n\nIn mentioning album sales, I'd like to point\
    \ out that people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of\
    \ them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the\
    \ heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really\
    \ aren't alone in feeling so alone. It isn't as easy today as it was 20 years\
    \ ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge\
    \ and motivate us\n\nThere are always going to be those artists who break through\
    \ on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever. The way I see it,\
    \ fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for\
    \ fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month\
    \ while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced\
    \ to). Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships\
    \ that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past\n\
    \nHowever, some artists will be like finding \"the one.\" We will cherish every\
    \ album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children\
    \ and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish\
    \ with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind\
    \ of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has\
    \ with Carly Simon\n\nI think forming a bond with fans in the future will come\
    \ in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I\
    \ did not say \"shock\"; I said \"surprise.\" I believe couples can stay in love\
    \ for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why can't this\
    \ love affair exist between an artist and their fans?\n\nIn the YouTube generation\
    \ we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing\
    \ almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them\
    \ something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest\
    \ performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to\
    \ flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we\
    \ got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope\
    \ the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping\
    \ their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be\n\nThere are\
    \ a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first\
    \ being autographs. I haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention\
    \ of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento \"kids these days\"\
    \ want is a selfie. It's part of the new currency, which seems to be \"how many\
    \ followers you have on Instagram.\"\nFan Power\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets\
    \ as low as $197You might also likeA friend of mine, who is an actress, told me\
    \ that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting\
    \ director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming\
    \ a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked\
    \ into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating\
    \ directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists\
    \ will get record deals because they have fans\u2014not the other way around\n\
    \nAnother theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing\
    \ great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The\
    \ wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds\
    \ like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds\
    \ like country\u2014and to me, that's incredible progress. I want to make music\
    \ that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the\
    \ idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational\
    \ tool\n\nThis moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an\
    \ artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your\
    \ comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted\u2026it is\
    \ celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all\n\n\
    Celebrity Spotlight\n\nI predict that some things will never change. There will\
    \ always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially\
    \ the younger ones. Artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s, '80s\
    \ and '90s tell me, \"It was never this crazy for us back then!\" And I suspect\
    \ I'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday (God help them). There\
    \ continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for\
    \ as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both\
    \ sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to\n\nAnd as for me? I'll just be sitting\
    \ back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while\
    \ trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism\n\nAnd I'd also like\
    \ a nice garden5"
  The Great War: "[Verse 1]\nMy knuckles were bruised like violets\nSucker punching\

    I''ve been a lot of lonely places

    I''ve never been on the outside

  The Power of Pop: "My favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more\
    \ than just tell you a story. They do more than just set the scene or paint the\
    \ picture. The writing I love the most places you into that story, that room,\
    \ that rain soaked kiss. You can smell the air, hear the sounds, and feel your\
    \ heart race as the character's does. It\u2019s something F. Scott Fitzgerald\
    \ did so well, to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional\
    \ revelations, that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment.\n\
    \nI'm highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to\
    \ a long-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time.\
    \ To this day, when I hear \"Cowboy Take Me Away\" by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly\
    \ recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled\
    \ room in my family home in Pennsylvania. I'm clutching a guitar and learning\
    \ to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig\
    \ at a coffee house. When I hear \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\" by Panic! At The\
    \ Disco, I\u2019m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets\
    \ of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming\
    \ the lyrics. When I hear \"How to Save a Life\" by The Fray, \"Breathe (2AM)\"\
    \ by Anna Nalick, or \"The Story\" by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback\
    \ to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When I'd get a day at home\
    \ in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I\
    \ would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room \u2013\
    \ just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the Grey's Anatomy soundtrack.\
    \ My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds). I'm convinced that \"You\
    \ Learn\" by Alanis Morissette, \"Put Your Records On\" by Corinne Bailey Rae\
    \ and \"Why\" by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups\
    \ or let downs.\n\n\nI love writing songs because I love preserving memories,\
    \ like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia\
    \ as inspiration when I'm writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs.\
    \ I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I\
    \ want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak\
    \ of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered\
    \ or healed or claimed forever.\n\nThe fun challenge of writing a pop song is\
    \ squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can\
    \ possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos\
    \ and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being,\
    \ well, universal. You'd think that as pop writers, we're supposed to be writing\
    \ songs that everyone can sing along to, so you'd assume they would have to be\
    \ pretty lyrically generic\u2026 AND YET the ones I think cut through the most\
    \ are actually the most detailed, and I don\u2019t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet\
    \ type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously.\
    \ (See \"Love Story,\" 2009).\nIn modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely\
    \ personal details like \"Kiki, do you love me\" and \"Baby pull me closer in\
    \ the backseat of your rover\" have been breaking through on the most global cultural\
    \ level. This year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along\
    \ to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana.\n\nI think these days, people\
    \ are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We\
    \ like being confided in and hearing someone say, \"this is what I went through\"\
    \ as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT\
    \ want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical\
    \ glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people\
    \ put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artist\u2019s story\
    \ invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us\
    \ the ability to assign that song to our memories. It's this alliance between\
    \ a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance,\
    \ or escape that truly stands the test of time. Just like a great book.See Taylor\

  The Story Of Us: '[Verse 1]

    I used to think, one day, we''d tell the story of us

    How we met and the sparks flew instantly

    And people would say, "They''re the lucky ones"

    I used to know my place was the spot next to you

    Now, I''m searching the room for an empty seat

    ''Cause lately, I don''t even know what page you''re on


    [Pre-Chorus]

    Oh, a simple complication

    Miscommunications lead to fallout

    So many things that I wish you knew

    So many walls up, I can''t break through


    [Chorus]

    Now, I''m standin'' alone in a crowded room

    And we''re not speakin''

    And I''m dyin'' to know

    Is it killin'' you like it''s killin'' me? Yeah

    I don''t know what to say since the twist of fate

    When it all broke down

    And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

    How''d we end up this way?

    See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy

    And you''re doin'' your best to avoid me

    I''m starting to think, one day, I''ll tell the story of us

    How I was losing my mind when I saw you here

    But you held your pride like you should''ve held me


    [Pre-Chorus]

    Oh, I''m scared to see the ending

    Why are we pretending this is nothin''?

    I''d tell you I miss you, but I don''t know how

    I''ve never heard silence quite this loud

    This is lookin'' like a contest

    Of who can act like they care less

    But I liked it better when you were on my side

    The battle''s in your hands now

    But I would lay my armor down

    If you said you''d rather love than fight

    So many things that you wish I knew

  The Trick to Holding On [Poem]: 'Let go of the ones who hurt you

    Let go of the ones you outgrow

    Let go of the words they hurl your way

    as you''re walking out the door

    The only thing cut and dry

    In this hedge-maze life

    Is the fact that their words will cut

    but your tears will dry


    They don''t tell you this when you are young

    You can''t hold on to everything

    Can''t show up for everyone

    You pick your poison

    Or your cure

    Phone numbers you know by heart

    And the ones you don''t answer any more


    Hold on to the faint recognition in

    the eye of a stranger

    As it catches you in its lustrous net

    How quickly we become intertwined

    How wonderful it is to forget

    All the times your intuition failed you

    But it hasn''t killed you yet

    Hold on to childlike whims and moonlight

    swims and your blazing self-respect

    See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $197And if you drive the roads of this
    town

    Ones you''ve gone down so many times before

    Flashback to all the times

    Life nearly ran you off the road

    But tonight your hand is steady

    Suddenly you''ll know

    The trick to holding on

    Was all that letting go3'
  "The Very First Night (Taylor\u2019s Version) [From The Vault]": '[Chorus]

    I''d write this in the sky

    I miss you like it was the very first night


    [Verse 1]

    And so it goes

    Every weekend, this same party

    I never go alone

    And I don''t seem broken-hearted

    My friends all say they know

    Everything I''m going through

    I drive down different roads

    But they all lead back to you


    [Pre-Chorus]

    ''Cause they don''t know about the night in the hotel

    They weren''t ridin'' in the car when we both fell

    Didn''t read the note on the Polaroid picture

    They don''t know how much I miss you

    Not trying to fall in love

    But we did like children runnin''

    Back then, we didn''t know

    We were built to fall apart

    We broke the status quo

    Then we broke each other''s hearts


    [Pre-Chorus]

    But don''t forget about the night out in L.A

    Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway

    No one knows about the words that we whispered

    No one knows how much I miss you

    Take me away, take me away

    Take me away to you, to you

    Take me away, take me away

    Take me away to you, to you

    I was ridin'' in the car when we both fell

    I''m the one on the phone as you whisper

    "Do you know how much I miss you?"

    I wish that we could go back in time

  "This Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things": '[Verse 1]

    It was so nice throwin'' big parties

    Jump into the pool from the balcony

    Everyone swimmin'' in a champagne sea

    And there are no rules when you show up here

    Bass beat rattling the chandelier

    Feelin'' so Gatsby for that whole year


    [Pre-Chorus]

    So why''d you have to rain on my parade?

    I''m shaking my head and locking the gates

    [Chorus]

    This is why we can''t have nice things, darlin''

    Because you break them, I had to take them away

    This is why we can''t have nice things, honey (Oh)

    Did you think I wouldn''t hear all the things you said about me?

    This is why we can''t have nice things


    [Verse 2]

    It was so nice being friends again

    There I was, giving you a second chance

    But you stabbed me in the back while shakin'' my hand

    And therein lies the issue, friends don''t try to trick you

    Get you on the phone and mind-twist you

    And so I took an axe to a mended fence

    And you said it reminded you of me?

    \ and generous company.\n\nThis is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album\
    \ and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing\
    \ live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their\
    \ first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter\
    \ who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would\
    \ get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate\
    \ and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in\
    \ their field\u2026but will not get paid for a quarter of a year\u2019s worth\
    \ of plays on his or her songs.\n\nThese are not the complaints of a spoiled,\
    \ petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and\
    \ producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we\
    \ admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.\n\
    \nI realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that\
    \ is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been\
    \ and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers\
    \ and producers for the 3 month trial period\u2026 even if it is free for the\
    \ fans trying it out.\n\nThree months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair\
    \ to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration\
    \ for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the\
    \ progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this\
    \ music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.\n\nBut I say to\
    \ Apple with all due respect, it\u2019s not too late to change this policy and\
    \ change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely\
    \ affected by this. We don\u2019t ask you for free iPhones. Please don\u2019t\

  Today Was a Fairytale: '[Intro]

    Today was a fairytale, you were the prince

    I used to be a damsel in distress

    You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six

    Today was a fairytale

    Today was a fairytale


    [Verse 1]

    Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress

    You wore a dark gray t-shirt

    You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess

  "We Were Happy (Taylor\u2019s Version) [From the Vault]": '[Verse 1]

    We used to walk along the streets

    When the porch lights were shining bright

    Before I had somewhere to be

    Back when we had all night and we were happy

    I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus

    You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it

    And we were happy


    [Chorus]

    When it was good, baby, it was good, baby

    We showed ''em all up

    No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark

    Talking ''bout your daddy''s farm we were gonna buy someday

    And we were happy


    [Verse 2]

    We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water

    That''s sorta how I feel right now

    And goodbye''s so much harder ''cause we were happy

    She thinks about it as she talks her talk

    School dance, first chance

    Always been a dreamer

    There''s one guy, she''s shy

    Sees him through the mirror

    And everybody looks at her

    She thinks about it

    Blue dress, angel face

    Looking in the mirror

    Shoes, purse, hair tied back

    And you should see her

    She''s got her magic

    Floating through the air

    That she''s been waiting for this all her life

    First date, can''t wait

    Looking in the mirror

    Heart all wrapped up

    Wait until he sees her

    He''s looking right at her

    She thinks about it

    Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt

    Shoes, purse, hair tied back

    Move to Paris

    Living on a prayer

  Who Knew / Unpretty: 'If someone said three years from now

    You''d be long gone

    I''d stand up and punch them out

    Cause they''re all wrong

    I know better, cause you said forever

    And ever, who knew?


    If someone said three years from now

    You''d be long gone

    That last kiss, I''ll cherish, until we meet again

    My darling, who knew?

    Because P!nk is from Philly, ladies and gentlemen!

    I wish I could tie you up in my shoes

    Make you feel unpretty too

    I was told I was beautiful

    But what does that mean to you?

    Look into the mirror, who''s inside there

    The one with the long hair

    Same old me again today, yeah


    My outsides look cool

    My insides are blue

    Every time I think I''m through

    It''s because of you

    I try different ways

    But it''s all the same

    At the end of the day

    I have myself to blame

    I''m just trippin''

    You can buy your hair if it won''t grow

    You can fix your nose if he says so

    You can buy all the make-up

    They can make, but if

    You can''t look inside you

    Find out who am I to

    Be in the position that make me feel

    So

    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

    Make you feel unpretty too

  Why She Disappeared [Poem]: 'When she fell, she fell apart.

    Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated

    as a child with sidewalk chalk

    When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away

    with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends


    When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink

    forming the words of a thousand voices

    Echoes she heard even in her sleep:

    "Whatever you say, it is not right."

    "Whatever you do, it is not enough."

    "Your kindness is fake."

    "Your pain is manipulative."


    When she lay there on the ground,

    She dreamed of time machines and revenge

    and a love that was really something,

    Not just the idea of something.


    When she finally rose, she rose slowly

    Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies

    Wary of phone calls and promises,

    Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes


    When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness

    Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck

    Bathed in her brokenness

    Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor

    she never knew she needed

    Standing broad-shouldered next to her

    was a love that was really something,

    not just the idea of something.

    See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $197When she turned to go home,

    She heard the echoes of new words

    "May your heart remain breakable

    But never by the same hand twice"

    And even louder:

    "without your past,

    you could never have arrived-

    so wondrously and brutally,

    By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance

    ...here."


    And in the death of her reputation,

    She felt truly alive.30'

  Writing Songs About You: '[Verse 1]

    I can''t believe you did it again

    Walked by and took my heart with you

    Why did you have to look so good?

    Don''t you know that I''m trying to hate you

    Trying to have a dream without you in it

    But how can I put out this fire

    When you''re the one who lit it


    [Chorus]

    I can''t wait for the day I stop pretending

    That I''m really OK when I''m not

    I want to know how it feels to be

    Over you for real

    Until I do

    I''ll keep writing songs about you


    [Verse 2]

    I''ve got a stack of papers so high

    And it''s all about you baby

    Keep thinking maybe I

    Can make sense of something crazy

    Something I can''t get out of my Head

    I write your name I write your name

    Then I tear it all to shreds

    I''ll keep writing songs about you


    [Verse 3]

    And if you ever change your mind

    And want me back again

    I hope these songs will remind me

    Why I shouldn''t let you in


    [Chorus]

    I can''t wait for the day I stop pretending

    That I''m really OK cause I''m not

    I want to know how it feels to be

    Over you for real

    Until I do


    [Chorus]

    I''ll just wait for the day

    I stop pretending

    That I''m really OK when I''m not

    I want to know how it feels to be over you for real

    Till I do

    I''ll keep writing songs about you'
  "You All Over Me (Taylor\u2019s Version) [From the Vault]": '[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]

    Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement

    Shouldn''t I find a stain? But I never do

    The way the tires turn stones on old county roads

    They leave ''em muddy underneath, reminds me of you

    You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know

    You can scratch it right off, it''s how it used to be

    But like the dollar in your pocket, it''s been spent and traded in

    You can''t change where it''s been, reminds me of me


    [Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]

    I lived and I learned

    Had you, got burned

    Held out and held on

    God knows, too long, and wasted time

    Lost tears, swore that I''d get out of here

    But no amount of freedom gets you clean

    I''ve still got you all over me


    [Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]

    The best and worst day of June

    Was the one that I met you

    With your hands in your pockets

    And your "Don''t you wish you had me?" grin

    Well I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child

    Now, every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

    I''ve still got you all over me


    [Instrumental Break]


    [Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]

    I lived and I learned

    And found out what it was to turn around

    And see that we

    Were never really meant to be

    So I lied, and I cried

    And I watched a part of myself die

    ''Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean

    I''ve still got you all over me

  You Are In Love: '[Verse 1]

    One look, dark room, meant just for you

    Time moved too fast, you play it back

    Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke

    No proof, not much, but you saw enough

    Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight

    The light reflects the chain on your neck

    He says, "Look up" and your shoulders brush

    No proof, one touch, but you felt enough


    [Chorus]

    You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you

    You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you

    You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)

    You are in love, true love

    You are in love


    [Verse 2]

    Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday

    You keep his shirt, he keeps his word

    And for once, you let go of your fears and your ghosts

    One step, not much, but it said enough

    You kiss on sidewalks, you fight and you talk

    One night, he wakes, strange look on his face

    Pauses, then says "You''re my best friend"

    And you knew what it was, he is in love

    You are in love, true love


    [Bridge]

    And so it goes

    You two are dancing in a snow globe, ''round and ''round

    And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown

    And you understand now

    Why they lost their minds and fought the wars

    And why I''ve spent my whole life trying to put it into words


    [Breakdown]

    ''Cause you can hear it in the silence

    You can feel it on the way home

    You are in love, true love

  You Belong With Me: '[Verse 1]

    You''re on the phone with your girlfriend, she''s upset

    She''s going off about something that you said

    ''Cause she doesn''t get your humor like I do

    I''m in the room, it''s a typical Tuesday night

    I''m listening to the kind of music she doesn''t like

    And she''ll never know your story like I do


    [Pre-Chorus]

    But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts

    She''s Cheer Captain and I''m on the bleachers

    Dreaming ''bout the day when you wake up and find

    That what you''re looking for has been here the whole time


    [Chorus]

    If you could see that I''m the one who understands you

    Been here all along, so why can''t you see?

    You belong with me, you belong with me


    [Verse 2]

    Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans

    I can''t help thinking this is how it ought to be

    Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself

    Hey, isn''t this easy?

    And you''ve got a smile that could light up this whole town

  "You\u2019re Not Sorry": '[Verse 1]

    All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around

    I''ve been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down

    And it''s taken me this long, baby, but I''ve figured you out

    And you''re thinking we''ll be fine again, but not this time around


    [Chorus]

    You don''t have to call anymore

    I won''t pick up the phone

    This is the last straw

    Don''t wanna hurt anymore

    And you can tell me that you''re sorry

    But I don''t believe you, baby, like I did before

    You''re not sorry (No, no, no, no)


    [Verse 2]

    You''re looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn''t know

    Could''ve loved you all my life if you hadn''t left me waiting in the cold

    And you''ve got your share of secrets

    And I''m tired of being last to know, oh

    And now, you''re asking me to listen ''cause it''s worked each time before


    [Chorus]

    But you don''t have to call anymore

    I won''t pick up the phone

    This is the last straw

    Don''t wanna hurt anymore

    And you can tell me that you''re sorry

    But I don''t believe you, baby, like I did before

    You''re not sorry (No, no, no, no)

    You''re not sorry (No, no, no, no)

    You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would''ve gone away, no

    You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade


    [Chorus]

    So you don''t have to call anymore

    I won''t pick up the phone

    This is the last straw

    There''s nothing left to beg for

    And you can tell me that you''re sorry

    But I don''t believe you, baby, like I did before

    You''re not sorry (No, no, no, no)

    You''re not sorry (No, no, no, no)

    (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

  "You\u2019re On Your Own, Kid": '[Verse 1]

    Summer went away, still, the yearning stays

    I play it cool with the best of them

    I wait patiently, he''s gonna notice me

    It''s okay, we''re the best of friends

    Anyway

    I hear it in your voice, you''re smoking with your boys

    I touch my phone as if it''s your face

    I didn''t choose this town, I dream of getting out

    There''s just one who could make me stay

    All my days


    [Pre-Chorus]

    From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes

    I waited ages to see you there

    I search the party of better bodies

    Just to learn that you never cared


    [Chorus]

    You''re on your own, kid

    You always have been


    [Verse 2]

    I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May

    I picked the petals, he loves me not

    Something different bloomed, writing in my room

    I play my songs in the parking lot

    I''ll run away

    You''re on your own, kid

    You always have been


    [Instrumental Break]


    [Bridge]

    From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes

    I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this

    I hosted parties and starved my body

    Like I''d be saved by a perfect kiss

    The jokes weren''t funny, I took the money

    My friends from home don''t know what to say

    I looked around in a blood-soaked gown

    And I saw something they can''t take away

    ''Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned

    Everything you lose is a step you take

    So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it

    You''ve got no reason to be afraid

    [Chorus]

    You''re on your own, kid

    Yeah, you can face this

    You''re on your own, kid

    You always have been42'

    Cancel plans just in case you''d call

    And say, "Meet me behind the mall"

    So much for summer love and saying "us"

    ''Cause you weren''t mine to lose

    What''s a lifetime of achievement

    If I pushed you to the edge

    But you were too polite to leave me?

    And do you miss the rogue

    Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?

  "\u200Bfolklore [Foreword]": 'It started with imagery. Visuals that popped into
    my mind and piqued my curiosity.


    Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty
    years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing
    in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of "let''s run away" and never doing
    it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored
    disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held
    through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your
    fate.


    Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters.
    I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from
    the perspective of people I''ve never met, people I''ve known, or those I wish
    I hadn''t. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn''t his own, wondering
    how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up
    at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing
    on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen
    High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow
    getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out.


    A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around.
    Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the
    boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation,
    over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables.
    Gossip and legend. Someone''s secrets written in the sky for all to behold.


    In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection
    of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a
    pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I''ve told these
    stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve.

    That prove she was not

    In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams

    She''s a crook who was caught

    Gets the spot that was yours

    Or trying to stay for the kids, when keeping it how it is

    Begging ''til my knees bled

    Praying to his greed

    Friends break up, friends get married

    Strangers get born, strangers get buried

    Trends change, rumors fly through new skies

    But I''m right where you left me

    Matches burn after the other

    Pages turn and stick to each other

    Wages earned and lessons learned

    But I, I''m right where you left me

    Help, I''m still at the restaurant

    Still sitting in a corner I haunt

    Cross-legged in the dim light

    They say, "What a sad sight," I

    I swear you could hear a hair pin drop

    Right when I felt the moment stop

    Glass shattered on the white cloth

    Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there

    Dust collected on my pinned-up hair

    They expected me to find somewhere

    Some perspective, but I sat and stared right where


    [Chorus]

    You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no

    You left me no choice but to stay here forever

    She''s still twenty-three inside her fantasy

    And you''re sitting in front of me

    When I was still the one you want

    Cross-legged in the dim light

  "\u201CHappy Voting! \U0001F5F3\U0001F603\U0001F308\u201D": "I\u2019m writing this\
    \ post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I\u2019\
    ll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I\u2019ve been reluctant to\
    \ publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and\
    \ in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now.\
    \ I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect\
    \ and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe\
    \ in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on\
    \ sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we\
    \ still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and\
    \ prevalent.\n\nI cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for\
    \ dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love.\
    \ Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn.\
    \ As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in\
    \ office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls\
    \ and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the\
    \ Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect\
    \ women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses\
    \ have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should\
    \ not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting\
    \ for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please,\
    \ please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based\
    \ on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find\
    \ a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to\
    \ vote anyway.\n\nSo many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have\
    \ turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make\
    \ their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to\
    \ do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to\
    \ vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! \U0001F5F3\U0001F603\U0001F308\

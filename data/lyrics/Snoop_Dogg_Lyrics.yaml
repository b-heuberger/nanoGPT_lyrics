    [Tray Dee]

    Another blast from the Long Beach section

    Straight gangsta shit (Wake up)

    [Verse 1: Tray Dee]

    Out on the scout I''m about my papers

    Cause ain''t nobody doin Dee no favors

    I''m trying to get major with minor risk

    Maximising the minimum of time is spent

    On the heist, nice and easy believe me

    I take mine and make mine extra cheesy

    Keepin niggas in a headlock

    Undress em, press em down in a full nelson

    I hit jacks off six packs of the crooked one

    They slip and I''m booking em

    Fuck fingerprints, gimme from their fingertips

    Chips to the neckline cos I got a Tec-9

    Check mine like a pimp-main ho

    So hope you only see me when my grip ain''t low

    I go up in ya like a skeleton

    So S-N-double O-Please let em know the crew I''m bailin with

    Is money all that makes you move?

    You ain''t doin what''cha s''posed to so you gots ta prove

    Somethin to the ones you love but you needs ta know

    If you ain''t doin it for yourself it don''t matter d''ooooh!

    Just to wake up, wake up, wake up...

    Wake up, wake up wake up...

    Get up, get up, get up..


    [Verse 2: Tray Deee]

    I break fools off like leprosy

    If they dare, you stare when they next to me

    I''mma threat to whoever sweat my style

    Hard gangsta aim to represent til death

    Reality, you battle me you be in the dirt quick

    I''m clever with whatever type of weapon I work with

    The bare hand man sleeper

    I even banked up and shank motherfuckers in the peepa

    I sanked a gang of tough fools in my time

    So try me you''re liable to lose on my line

    The 44''ll be what cracks ya head

    Cos that''s exactly what I''m bout ta cap you with

    Criminal with style and boy you love that

    Sit back relax and let me drop another rap

    But this one''s for the sisters and not the hoes

    But don''t blow a nigga up or show a nigga up

  "(Tear \u2019Em Off) Me & My Doggz": '[Intro]

    The dog saw ''im...they tear...they...looked liked they try to tear him off

    I said "Oh my God! They want to eat my husband"


    [Verse 1]

    I was sittin'' at the pound about to eat dinner

    Had a hard day at the studio, I was gettin thinner

    My nigga Sparky-O was playin'' basketball

    And my niggas in the backyard, ''bout to squab my Doggz

    Dirty [?] gets CREAM, it''s a good scheme

    But you know it''s all a part of the Corleone team

    I squabble...Friday cos that''s what I do

    Dogg Pound for life nigga, uhh thought you knew

    But you didn''t, you think I''m kiddin nigga, my Doggz scrap

    They get down for theirs, bring ''em right to the back

    Hit the gate don''t wait and ask the homie Nate

    He gotta pit named Tiny mobbin behind him

    Now they''ve got Michael Corleone

    Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin

    He likes to smash on, uhh

    And ain''t no need to reach for heat ''cause you can''t get your blast on

    Doggz, we keep ''em, busters we sweep ''em

    And when it''s drama, my Doggz''ll bite your mama

    We leave you niggas on stuck in paws

    And I''ma dedicate this one to my Doggz

    Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey?

    Uhh, she got killed so I didn''t need him

    Uhh, it''s like that, what about Sweetie?

    He got killed too (damn) so I didn''t need him

    It''s a cold thang, but it''s a cold game

    But when you wit'' a Corleone name, it''s a cold thang

    Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down

    ''Cause if you don''t then you can''t represent the Pound

    Now it''s like a sport

    And if I get caught I''m right back in court

    So I gots to keep it on the DL and don''t yeezell

    But you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell

    So if you wanna get get one, holla at''cha boy quick

    ''Cause I''ma be on the lookout for the sale of ''dem pits

    Ask my little homey Technique

    I ''came Scarface, Corleone killers, baby boy OG

    The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat

    But the rest of the pits they rollin'' wit me

    We''re layin'' low in the cut, holstered up in Chino

    Scrappy-Du and the crew called the Gambinos

    Ma bark and she''ll spark up some shit real quick

    Just last week y''know what? She bit the shit out of me

    Think that bitch is a trick, I had to get coffee

    To get the bitch up off me

    And I can''t tame her and I can''t blame her

    That''s why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer

    Man, it''s a shame-uh nigga got love for y''all

    But I got more love for my motherfuckin'' Doggz

    Get your Puppy Chow (sick ''em, sick ''em)


    [Verse 2]

    Now when it comes to my Doggz they stay fly like geese

    But as for me I''m Snoop Dogg I''m soopafly like Priest

    I unleash my Doggz then I tilt my brim

    I''m bout to trip off Locko ''cause he go taken my swim

    I think ''cause my CREAMy low, get back to the pound

    He gon'' be itchin'' like hell to put the bite on the clown

    And when you look with the frown he gon'' get like 1-2

    And ain''t a damn thang that your ass can do

    I think it''s ''cause he lost his big homey Don Killer see

    Who ran the whole yard and gangbanged OP

    And leave your ass red and yeah half-head

    He''s a damn fool, he''ll jack you for pants leg

    Don''t beg you''re dead, and don''t dare show fear

    Young gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head

    And all he could do was cry like a bitch

    His life was a pit and mine''s in the shit

    [Chorus]

    (Beware, beware)

    (Sick em) It''s just me and my doggz

    I keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard

    Just in case you niggas wanna fuckin'' try to act hard

    ....deadly serious in East Los Angeles and South Central where people

    It''s just me and my doggz

    Encounter stray dogs on a daily basis and often bare the scars to prove it'

    Reap while I stay gettin Richard like Pryor

    Need to put the gun away cause I got priors

    It''s hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders

    Bullet tip on fire, flyin down sunset

    And thats what I''m supposed to think

    Flinch at me like I''m supposed to blink

    Motherfucker this Crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill

    And chronic we can smoke on, and forever get our loc on

    Strolling through the Park one day

    Puffing on a fat ass J, with my homie named Tray

    Deee tryin'' to see if we could put this LBC thing

    Back together like it was supposed to see


    [Tray Deee]

    Cause ya know I''m down with ya, to make ''em get the picture

    And if I have to sit ya, down then I spit ya

    Game from the heart, I came from the start

    See I was regulating, when Cragars was the Daytons


    [Snoop]

    Nigga let me interact with my black croaker sacks*

    And a gray golf hat tilted to the back (what''s up?)

    Ditchin'' Sunday school to get a pack of Now and Laters

    While I''m rolling with the Steelers and killin'' with the raiders


    [Tray Deee]

    And when we bang with the Saints then we ain''t no joke

    Come around from outta bounds and we goes for broke

    [Snoop]

    Now we''re breaking ''em up (hmm hmm), shaking em up (yeah)

    And just for a second we''re waking ''em up

    (continue) Giving up game on this tight ass beat

    With a small dedication, to two-one street3'

    Overworked but I''m still committed

    Gracefully gazing unto the sky

    A lot of people smoke just to get by

    But I see things much differently

    Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically

    Put it in a letter so you let it be

    One day we''ll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree

    You don''t like edibles? Then I got plenty of flowers to blow

    [Snoop Dogg]

    It all goes back, to ''85

    When I start gettin pussy every day of my life

    It really didn''t matter what the bitch look like

    I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight

    Wouldn''t you believe it, Dogg like a retriever

    I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva

    She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa

    She told me to undress her, yessir

    Ain''t no pressure, later that semester

    She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha

    She was so vicious, lips so luscious

    Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes

    Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her

    I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up

    Big bucks, no whammies

    I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy

    She lived in the Valley, she couldn''t understand me

    But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi

    Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch

    She moved to the hood from the 2-0-6

    She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels

    And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls

    Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game

    So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team

    And we began makin, breakin bitches takin

    Whatever we want, see she want with the fakin

    It''s real in the field, no mistakin

    And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican

    Time and time again she would bring me bud

    And let me beat it up, listenin to "One Love"

    Off some jerk chicken, I got mo'' bitches

    Now I''m fuckin her sister it''s gettin real suspicious

    But the dick is good, so they won''t tell

    And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell

    She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit

    But I''mma holla back, cause I''m on another bitch

    I''m on some other shit, I got a phone call

    From the motherfuckin president y''all

    He said, "Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch

    And make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?"

    I called and look here, this what you do

    Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you

    I think he got it, cause he left fast

    He left his daughters, and a lot of cash

    Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G

    Major pimpin, out in D.C

    And I''m a young pimp, got a lot of growin left

    And you''s a young ho with a lot of hoein left

    Always keep a ho in check, blowin us a train wreck

    Yeah I might have to go in depth

    See every little ho I met

    They''re standouts, you know the ones like Yvette

    We fucked in the car, behind a bar

    I shot it in her face and it went "Ahhh"

    My homeboy Charles

    Went up in his sister, behind the garage

    I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick

    When y''all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick

    Always tryin to go up in a ho

    Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo''

    You know just what I told her?

    I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her

    And now they threw me out, now I''m at the pad

    I''m at a new school, way cool

    New hoes, new script, fresh fish

    Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch

    I''m in some new tail, wanna holla back

    But for now let me holla back Impala black

    She''s a 12th grader, in my science class

    And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I''m movin fast

    See I was taught by, and I was taught I

    Better move on somethin fast if I thought I

    Could claim a dame, or game her brain

    Or tame a man, not with the same old game

    See on some different stuff, I''m a different cut

    It''s what I say and do to make the bitch give it up

    Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too

    Now what you gon'' do, when they ask you

    Is you gon'' tell a lie, or you gon'' keep it G

    Or you gon'' hold it all inside or you gon'' tell on me?

    Shit it''s all cool, cause it was all good

    It''s just another day in Doggy Dogg''s neighborhood

    You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose

    It''s a 90 percent chance she gon'' get pimp juice

  A Message 2 Fat Cuzz: '[Snoop]

    Ya,uh

    I was once told

    You get your freedom

    By letting your enemy know that

    Youll do anything to get your freedom

    Then youll get it

    Its the only way youll get it

    When you get that kind of attitude

    Theyll label you as a crazy negro

    Or they just call you a crazy nicca

    They dont say negro

    Or theyll call you an extremist

    Or a subversive

    Or a setatus

    Or a red or radical

    But when you stay radical long enough

    And get enough people to like you

    Youll get your freedom

    So dont rum around here

    Tryin to make friends

    With somebody whos deprivin''

    You of your rights

    Their not your friends

    NO.. they ya enemys

    And treat them like that

    And fight them

    And youll get your freedom

    And after you get your freedom

    Your enemy will respect you, and will respect you

    And i say that with no hate

    Cuz i dont have no hate in me

    I have no hate at all

    So i say to you, Big Man

    Im the man you think you are

    If you want to know what ill do

    Figure out what youll do

    And ill do the same

    Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock

    I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks


    [Verse 2]

    What''s beef? ''Cause beef is in the kitchen

    What you want dog? I''m on a million-dollar mission

    How can you get it if you ain''t been through shit?

    I''m just a seed that was planted by Ruthless

    My family tree is so G, we was cut from the cloth called LBC

    Crybaby, used to C-Walk at the park

    Pitbulls on a leash that would never bark

    Real love, real dubs, real ''saniacs

    Trip Locc, kinfolk, and Wayniac

    Peace to the deceased that passed away

    "Duces ''n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way"

    What you gon'' do

    When we pull up in a hood near you?

    You know

    [Chorus]

    I used to come through with the tools and Glocks

    Party don''t rock like it used to rock

    Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock

    I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks

    I used to come through with the tools and Glocks

    Party don''t rock like it used to rock

    Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock

    I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks

    Yeah, certified official gangsta shit

    Unfiltered, like a pack of humps, nigga

    Detrimental to all and any that disrespect or deviate from the G calls

    It''s either hog status or buster status

    It ain''t no in betweens

    You can''t wake up and put this on, nigga

    Every breath you breathe gotta be committed to this shit

    Clappin'' niggas, tappin'' switches, mackin'' bitches

    Mansion business and stackin riches

    It''s all a part of that lifestyle we created back in the days for the world to
    follow

    Gs up, forever

    \ was real good with numbers\nSo Jimmy outgrew home before the average kid was\
    \ grown \u200B\nYa, dig what I'm talking about?\nSo, as Jimmy grew old and got\
    \ on his own\nHe went from state to state\nCounty to county, city to city, runnin\u2019\

    Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind

    Think how many plots blossoms to how many times

    I''m sedatin my asphixiated from beginnin broke

    And the bombest weed smoke that''ll make a nigga choke

    To my loc''s way down in the Valley deep

    To my homies in the Pound from L.A. and the Beach

    To my bulls out in Philly, cause all they smoke is phillies

    With these silly-ass bitches out for a niggas riches

    Now really, will he ever slip or trip

    A big shout out, to my niggas in Darby Twp

    I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC''s like ships

    With my nocturnal vibes and editorial clips

    I got a click, that''ll hit you like a thousand volts

    The homies catchin cases robberies and assaults

    It ain''t my fault that my shit might hit like that

    Listen and get elevated off the verbal contact

    My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid

    Hurt ''em in the worst way, put it down for myself

    Put ''em to rest, confess, nevertheless

    Snatch ''em a cap and destroy ''em at my best

    For the simple fact with contact, we the block entourage

    We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast

    And the rest of the jungle I''ll mistreat

    Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z

    I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre

    In ninety-six, with a different approach on shit

    I got the flavor, and I''m major

    Busta-ass niggas can''t stop us, and can''t fade us

    Shady-ass niggas can''t stand next to ya

    When the Tek connects to ya

    Swift as a cheetah when I''m catchin ya

    I betcha I won''t let ya escape, face the real on point

    They''re trained to kill, beyond the violated area

    When the smoke clears the area whether I''m toast(?) or at home

    I blaze the zag or the bone

    Once again another zone is gone

    MC''s try to step they get lit and blown

    At the end the lights go out so before they do

    I''m a L-B-C on through, stayin true

    Demandin my respect, respect is what I''ve given

    So respect is what I expect, the money got me driven

    To the point of no return - so the streets I roam

    Don''t catch chrome to the dome of this flack black

    .45 calibre Glock gat, gun, or pistol

    Whistle, and watch all my homeboys come

    Run, or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with

    When we bust, I let loose

    This is pre-meditated dick-up

    To all the busters that jealous and hate it, but can''t fade it

    Consequences get suffered

    I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers

    The bill is crisp (the deal is) the deal is this

    I gotta plot ''em on a mash for my chips

    Get in my way and get stepped on

    I''m stompin, steppin, with my projectile weapon


    [Verse 4: Techniec]

    With subjects all subject to harm, when I swarm through

    Who knew about the real deal I conceal?

    And still, can you feel, the topic of the whole situation is trust

    No ho is a must

    If I bust my brain constructs to form knowledge to the max

    Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs

    We wax tracks and smack up MC''s who compose the violence

    Bringin drama, with no parental guidance

    Eyes went deceived, somethin up my sleeve to intrigue

    And these MC''s''ll be G''s

    Also D-P-G''s and, L-B-C''s when

    We do the do to you so go call your crew

    And who, wants to compete with Techniec

    Conflict will be verbal, so watch how you speak

    And what you say when I display

    Sleepless acts that''s bomb to ya, suffer from insomnia

    And I''ma, gonna be comin for you

    So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew

    (Watch out nigga!)

    [Outro: Snoop Dogg]

    It''s a sucker MC barbecue cookout

    Look out.. watch out now!

    Ha-ha yeah, witcha bad self, watch out!'

    It''s the beginning with the pearls you''re given

    The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon

    But everyday like 50 say, it''s Many Men

    They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends

    But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs

    Then the hoes, then the clothes, I''mma have to let ''em go

    You know how the Dogg roll, don''t get it twisted

    Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit

    Non-stop, I beat it up and tell that bitch to get ghost

    (They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)

    Hollarin'' out, poppin'' a collar out

    And talkin'' shit on the phone to me at my baby-mama''s house

    (who''s she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am

    You better read your motherfuckin'' press telegram

    You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me

    Had to cut the bitch up ''cus she tried to get too close to me

    And tried to confront me at a club one night

    Fuckin'' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)

    But you know I had to stop and I paused

    And I put my hand on my balls and said check this out, dog

    I got my own spot and I got my own keys

    So can''t no bitch talk shit to me

    Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks

    And kicked me up outta spot

    I learned a lesson, I wasn''t guessin'' or stressin''

    I got another bitch and she was at the convalescent home

    She said she needed a companion

    Shit I needed a chaperone plus a new home

    Snap, crack, it''s on

    But in no time at all seems she fell in love

    But I wasn''t ready for that

    Topcat had to scat

    I hit her friend from the back

    While she was at work workin''

    I was jerkin'' that skirt

    And fuckin with all her friends that was flirtin''

    And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)

    A week later she fucked my homeboy Kurt

    Again it''s up in the wind, feel the breeze for sheez

  "Can\u2019t Say Goodbye": '[Hook: Charlie Wilson]

    I''m a man, I gotta take care of my family

    Fighting these pressures in my life

    I know my mind should be on shinin'' and gettin'' Grammy''s

    But these streets won''t say goodbye


    [Intro: Charlie Wilson] (Snoop Dogg)

    I can''t say goodbye (To the blocks)

    Goodbye (To the hood)

    Goodbye (To the streets)

    I can''t say goodbye (To the hood)

    Goodbye (To the blocks)

    Goodbye (To the streets)

    I can''t say goodbye (To the blocks)

    Goodbye (To the streets)

    Goodbye (To the hood)

    I can''t say goodbye (To the hood)

    Goodbye (To the blocks)

    Goodbye (To the homies)


    [Verse 1]

    I guess it''s true, you can''t take the hood out the homeboy

    Plus my hood just lost another homeboy

    Another one got locked, and we don''t know

    If he comin'' home boy

    The industry tell me, just leave it alone boy

    Let them do them, take care of your own boy

    But I sit back, think about, before I was grown boy

    Then had dreams of bein'' a doe boy

    Yeah I was runnin'' from the po-po, bangin'' for the turf

    Late night huntin'', puttin'' in work

    Hood day comin'', airbrushed shirt

    Payday at the spot, got my haircut first

    Made mom sick when I wouldn''t go to church

    See I live in the ''burbs but I think 21st

    I know since I''ve left that it''s gotten much worse

    But I''d still be there if I couldn''t write a verse

    You might also like[Hook]


    [Verse 2]

    To the blocks that raised me

    The enemies and the homies that made me

    Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me

    Critics wonder if I''m tryin'' to be the old me

    But if they think the old me ever left

    Then they don''t really know me

    And gon'' know we don''t change, we just become O.G

    You always addicted to the life, you just don''t O.D

    But shit, I owe the streets before they owe me

    Took me in when my mama didn''t want me

    Too wild to be her child, and pops not around

    Now all I got now is the homies

    To teach me, how to be a man and what not

    How to break ounces into grams and what not

    The reason I''m so nice with my hands and what not

    Shit, you think I forgot? Nah


    [Hook]


    [Verse 3]

    Thank God every day that the boy could spit

    And all around the world they enjoyin'' my shit

    I know I got plenty more awards to get

    I got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids

    But it wouldn''t be right if I ignored the shit

    That made me who I am, the music and the man

    Told me that I can before the world gave a damn

    If it wasn''t for my niggas sayin'' stick to the plan

    Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand

    Probably be doin'' a dub in the pen with my man

    They say leave the streets but they don''t really understand

    All I had was the block when I didn''t have fans

    Rapped on the corners when I couldn''t get spins

    All I had was the homies when I didn''t have kids

    If it all came down, my career was to end

    I''m sure my name would live, in these streets

  Change Gone Come: '[Chorus: Mabvuto Carpenter]

    Just because the choir sings

    They say that change gon'' come

    So when is change gon'' come?

    Somebody tell me, somebody tell me


    [Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    They throw the rock, hide they hand and wait for you to trip

    Then show the worst on the news, "Look y''all, he was a Crip"

    Now what am I supposed to do when family''s on the line?

    And how am I to stay calm with that still on my mind?

    Bodies droppin'' by the dozens

    The people sworn to protect is killin'' all my cousins

    For that, I keep my head on a swivel, Dogg''s out the kennel

    Don''t you want revenge just a little? Shit

    What do you tell a mother in pain who lost a child

    By the hands of the people she called?

    For a situation across the street

    When all he did was walk over to keep the peace? Cold game

    Now she gotta live with seein'' that whole thing

    Nobody got charged for the murder - more pain

    [Verse 2: Bad Lucc]

    As the world comes crashin'' down around you

    You''re sittin'' in that fire like nothin'' here can down you

    You find ease in pain and some comfort, this life has consumed you

    It''s dark everywhere you look, my tears amuse you

    You''ve gotta break free from that trap, but trust, I get it

    When hopeless start shapin'' your focus, life is wicked

    I used to be that type of guy who smiled in all the pictures

    And then I had my face where I would drown it out in liquor

    Told the world that I would be the man, and baby, I will

    I tend to talk to the ancestors when I''m prayin'' for real

    Hopin'' for better, while capitalists capitalize

    You had a heart of gold once, don''t matter the size

    They put the pressure on a youngin'', youngin'' grew up to kill

    And put that youngin'' in a prison just to ruin his will

    See, it''s the hard pill to swallow and faith is your throttle

    Still find myself prayin'' for tomorrow

    Sam was born by the river (River)

    The gangster white walls and the wood

    You see, there comes a time in a man''s life

    Where you gotta choose the goods of the game

    Oh, but it so hard to turn your back on a place

    Where everybody knows your name


    [Verse: Snoop Dogg]

    It''s a cold game, I ain''t been one to

    Jump in and out of the range

    Maybe an old school synagogue

    Spinnin'' the vision from which I faint

    You got to do it, you can, gotta keep rhymin''

    East Side High enjoyin'' life, hair blowin'' in the wind

    The state that I''m in is gangster bliss

    This is what you''re callin'' a sis

    Passin'' them off quick, memories missed

    I made a lot of friends, a whole lot of money

    Been down a couple times, but it never stopped my rhymin''

    In fact, I got better, clutchin'' on Beretta''s

    Blowin'' a sticky, turn it to whether

    A war shows in dough free lobos, this is how a player roll

    And I never be questioned by some new young chump

    Poppin'' their toss, Snoopy D.O. made the way for you to walk

    Owe it to the almighty, without you it couldn''t be done

    Your praise put the rise of the son, you dig?

    Hold closer my hands from my throne

    And I never be crucified within my own zone

    Here is a very good reason to show love

    But you gotta separate grown man from grown thug

    From almost goin'' down for murder in ''93

    To keys all over the city bowlin'' in Snoops league

    I changed, I got smarter, I got a daughter

    Two sons, beautiful wife for starters

    I did it all, Jack, poppin'' this peas

    Eatin'' international cuisine overseas, yeah

    Don''t judge me, you only knew Snoopy

    You never tried to know Calvin, you tried to groove me up

    Like some loco, I earned my respect

    Did so much shit for the Coast, I should get a check

    But all in all, I did it big

    Cool as a blind with a C

    Leveled my life as I push away the groupies

    Snoopin'' in a coopin'', you can call me Uncle Snoopy

    So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed

    Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong

    Cause out here, momma don''t have, and poppa don''t have

    As God blessed the child that can go get his own

    And we struggle hard suffer long, I''m feelin like this life is a trip

    Tryin to keep our hearts pure through the sins

    But the race ain''t to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich

    But to them they can endure to the end and win

    Even Jes'' pray, hey, with difficulty comes ease

    There''s disease, poverty, congestion or oppression

    I''m askin'' for your protection and thanking you for your blessing

    Confession is good for the soul, that''s how I''m tryna roll

    Be one of the greats, see the Pearly Gates now that''s the goal

    Until then, forgive my sin if that ain''t askin too much

    Now that''s tabernacle, chuuuch!'

    Need fur on my eardrums

    Here he come, here he - here he come

    S to the N double O P to the D to the O to the double G

    Smooth with the vocal tone

    I''m rockin on the microphone

    Yes this is freestyle, LBC style, G style

    Shout out to ? and Michael Vick

    I know the Eagles will be back next year

    But don''t even trip, cause Snoop Dogg is packin a cold grip

    I like to flip and dip

    And take you on the mothership

    So you can ride and roll and get control

    And lemme show you how I get cold

    I might get, I might get lifted

    I tripped it and dropped it

    Never ever flopped it

    And then they try to stop it

    But you can''t cause I''m hard in the paint

    When I bust freestyles, make the suckas faint

    It''s all off the dome

    Big Snoop Dogg and I''m halfway home

    I need to use the phone

    Could you give a dogg a bone?

    I''m leaning and everybody lookin at me screaming

    They wanna get a picture of the D O dub

    All the ladies in the hall love

    Even the big boss, he wanna get a picture

    Cause he know it don''t cost

    And that''s how it go

    Big Snoop Dogg, I''mma start the show

    Yeah, take a picture with me

    Have a seat, come and kick it with me

    In the middle, I''m on the side

    Wiz on the left so you know how we ride

    And when we came, we both got high

    And they got mad and told us put it out cause "fire"

    But you know we don''t quit

    We just kept smoking and I took another hit

    Went to the kitchen and I had me some chicken wings

    And baby said "Dogg can you sing?"

    For Cosmic Kev, I said "cool I got a freestyle

    That I just put on the top of my head

    And then I came in and dropped it for him"

    Pushed record and popped it for him

    Baby start filming it now

    She say "Snoop Dogg breaking it down!"

    She got the camera, I got the rap

    I got the wraps and I got the snaps

    I got the sack and he''s got the Lac

    And he got the dippy-dippy scratch in the back

    Cosmic Kev, this is how we do it

    Big Snoop Dogg coming through with the do-it fluid

    My music is dope, I never ever choke

    And if I wasn''t rapping I''d probably be broke

    No I''m lying to y''all

    It''s only Big Snoop and I''m the Top Dogg

    That means that I''m gonna get money

    No matter what I''m doing it''s sunny

    I haven''t made a call to my granny yet

    She say "Snoop Dogg, don''t worry about it grandson!"

    Cause when it comes to rap, you the only one

    You don''t need a Grammy, you got a Soul Train Award

    And a BET, everthing is on cue, and you know how you be

    And you keep smoking reefer, and these suckas is broke

    But you can''t touch me, cause I''m just cold

    When it comes to the freestyle off the top of my brain

    And I''m 40 years old, but it sounds like I''m 17

    Cause when I be rocking, I''m oh so clean

    And I''m on the hip-hop scene

    Been doing this since I was about 17

    And niggas 16, niggas 14, it don''t matter

    Loc, the Ese wit the black knights just got stole on

    And he fell to the ground

    Plus, his homie''s ain''t around so he better get a beat down

    It''s not a jack for his scratch nor his shoes

    It''s life in the county and the county gives plenty blues

    One point for the black guys

    They rolled him up, swelled and belled

    And left him with two black eyes

    He still alive so he know what''s next

    Young nigga, welcome to 95-hundred

    And don''t try to lie like you don''t bang

    You betta check yaself before ya wreck yaself

    Cause Doggy Dogg is a muthafuckin'' hog

    And size ain''t shit where ya at

    While ya slippin'' ya get somethin'' shanked in ya back

    And busta-ass niggas don''t really wanna see me

    In or out of the facility

    I''m kickin'' it real to ya so you should real with me

    Don''t come like bitch

  Do You Remember: '[Intro: Snoop Dogg (Charlie Wilson)]

    Y''all remember?

    (Do y''all remember)

    Remember


    [Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    Did y''all remember how it useta be

    Wasn''t no trippin'', we all family

    Hold hands with me, make plans with me

    For once in a lifetime, here''s your chance to be

    Now dance for me

    Like you did when you was a kid

    It wasn''t where you was from, it was where ya lived

    I give, to the girls when they got up outta church

    Pray for me, that I don''t get hurt

    I gotta work, I''m tryna get some G''s

    What you scheme?

    As the stars are gone

    [?]

    Now tha police, gettin'' tricky

    They sent ''em, we out

    Undercover, to get me

    Contradict me, but I''m just too slippery

    Somehow, someway them muthafuckas missed me

    While they nappin'' I''m rappin'', stackin''

    And lookin'' for them niggas on the move, that''s jacking

    Their deposits hot, but ya not

    Prepare to shoot or get shot

    Long as it''s from me to you or you to me

    It really don''t matter unless you say you gon'' bring the thing

    Cause I''m a g from the old school

    I squab from the shoulders, whole thangs over

    Don''t call me Snoop or Calvin [?]

    Thinking a nigga young cause a nigga getting older

    [Chorus: Charlie Wilson]

    Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhh

    I keep a gat in my pants, just incase ya check


    [Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

    Aye, it ain''t the love just cause he black

    I''ll put you on the map like that

    Now, I''ll give ya dap, if you''s a real one

    That kill for the right thang

    Not for the wrong thang!

    Grab [?]

    And get ya gangbang on mane

    And do it like they used to do on Soul Train

    When I was a little bitty nigga from the city

    There wasn''t no killin'', dealin'', just happy feelin''s

    I''mma take it back to how it was

    If you down wit'' me can I get a right on cuz

    (right on)


    [Chorus: Charlie Wilson]

    I keep a gat in my pants just in case ya checkin''

    (6x)


    [Bridge: Charlie Wilson]

    Not just knee deep, she was going real deep when she went down on me

    (3x)

    [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]

    Now I know I gots to get it cause I want it now I gots to have it

    See this the West coast anthem

    Now is that tragic?

    If yo'' set and my set, yo'' hood and my hood

    Nigga it''s all to the good

    That''s how we do it in the 9-8

    No playa hate

    Just take some shades and regulate

    And represent the Golden State

    And get them muthafuckas swole in the face

    I need bank, like Dre used to make

    When NWA was in the muthafuckin'' place

    The case was dropped, Cristal was popped

    Then the big Dogg got snatched by the cops

    No longer will Dogg be given ya muthafuckin'' props

    I''m grown now, on my own now

    Not my daddy but pop goes the weasel

    For tryna play me in the paint like Shaq Diesel

    See i''m a lil man wit'' a big thang

    But I''d rather make big change in the game

    See the block gets hot when ya not prepared to shoot or get shot

    So for me and you or you and me

    It really don''t matter what ya say ya gonna do to me

    Cause I''m a G from the old school

    I squabble from the shoulders till the whole thangs over

    Don''t call me Snoopy

    [?]

    Think a nigga dumb cause a nigga gettin'' older

    [Chorus: Charlie WIlson]


    [Outro: Charlie Wilson]

    I keep a gat in my pants just in case ya checkin''

    (2x)

    Not just knee deep, she was going real deep when she went down on me1'

    I used to wonder what the funk was

    The Bigg Homie said ''Give em what they want cuz''

    I can''t remember gettin high as a muthafucker

    Walking by not saying hi to muthafuckers

    Little mama told me, don''t get it wrong its the truth, but I

    Prefer to have a nigga like Soopafly

    Believe me I''m goin all out

    And niggas trip when they see me up at Dogg House

    He''s the neighborhood drug dealer, my man

    I go upstairs, I hug my mother

    I kiss my sister and I punch my brother

    I sit down on the bed to watch some TV

    [Gun Shots] Do my ears decieve me

    No That''s the fourth time this week

    Four young brothers got shot in the street

    The very next day while I''m off to class

    My momma go to work cold bustin'' her ass

    My sisters cute but shes got no gear

    I got three pair of pants and with my brother I share

    So there in school I made a fool

    With one and a half pair of pants, you ain''t cool

    Cause there''s no dollars for nothing else

    I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf

    Now everyday I see my momma struggling

    So now its time I got to do something

    I look for work

    I get dissed like a jerk

    I do odd jobs

    And come home like a slob

    So here comes Dogg his gold is shivery

    He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery

    I do it once I do it twice

    And now there''s stake with the beans and rice

    My mothers nervous but she knows the deal

    My sisters gear now has sex appeal

    My brothers my partner and were getting paper

    And three months later the whole hood cought the vapors

    My family''s happy and everything is new

    Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

    Hmm, money is flowing everything is fine

    I bought my self and Uzi and my brother a nine

    Business is booming everything is cool

    I pull about a G a week, fuck school

    A year passed by and I began to grow

    Not in height but juice and cash flow

    I kick up my feet to watch some t.v

    Cause now I got other people working for me

    I got a 55" television you know

    And every once in a while I hear "Just say no"

    Or the other commercial I love

    That''s when they say this is you brain on drugs

    I pick up the remote control and just turn

    Cause with this bullshit I''m not concerned

    Me and my brother bounced in the Benz

    We driving around our territory again

    I pull up at the light like a superstar

    An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car

    I hit the accelerator scared as shit

    I drove one block to find my brother was hit

    He wasn''t dead but the blood was pouring

    And all I could think about was Warren

    Later I found it was Dogg and his crew

    Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

    I can''t believe that Dogg would dis me

    That faggot that punk he soft or sissy

    I driving around with three of my guys

    The war is on and I''m on the rise

    We rolled right up to Dogg''s favorite hang out

    What''s cracking Dogg and let the bullets stang out

    Someone shot back so we took cover

    And all I could about was my brother

    Dogg jumped up and began to run

    Bustin shots hoping to hit someone

    So I just stopped and let off three shot

    Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop

    I threw down the gun and began to shout

    "Ay y''all all lets break out got ''em dip out

    Now as I left there goes the boys in blue

    They pointin they guns at my four man crew

    They shot down one, they shot down two

  "Don\u2019t Do The Crime": '[Chorus, snoop singing]

    Don''t do the crime if you can''t do the time

    Yeah

    Don''t do it


    Fell off into a party in the cpt

    Niggas looking at me strange

    But I''m up on the game

    I ain''t f**king with them niggas no mo

    Shit, I feel the same way y''all feel

    Nigga, f**k death row (ha ha)

    I cut em loose, send em juice

    With visine in their cup

    Catch em slipping, all my homeys get em stuck

    It''s the tale of a whale locked in a cell

    On the streets he was the heat cause ''cause had major mail

    Had his homeboys plugged, wearing gold chains

    Hanging at the studio, splurging and thangs

    Nigga f**king off money, saving them hoes

    F**ked off some money of mine

    And bought me a white rolls

    Living on wilshire in a penthouse suite

    F**king bad bitches seven days a week

    Colder than a motherf**ker but now I''m hot

    Floss me a brand new suit from dionne scott

    I guess I''m balling now

    Money falling down

    I can hear them movie star bitches calling me now

    Doggy dogg come and get with the pg

    Mr. calvin broadus could you please come and see me

    But I ain''t tripping, I''m just dogg pound cripping

    Talking big shit and in a bulletproof dipping

    Make my own beats, so f**k y''all too

    And I''m down with the niggas from the you know who

    We get to the point

    Blaze the joint

    Step into the party and holla at everybody

    As long as the gin get mixed with juice

    And the five on the crap game gon hit with deuce

    Shit niggas gon be niggas so nigga, nigga what

    Just because I''m having paper don''t mean f**k

    I once was in the same predicament you was

    Thinking to myself "damn should I kill ''cause? "

    But I know deep in my heart

    You might also likeTwo wrongs ain''t right

    And it started from a fist fight

    I only got one life to live

    I''m trying to see a grandfather with some grandkids

    You dig?

    I''m trying to live long like my hair

    Put the shit down, like fred estaire

    I want to share my world

    But how the f**k can I share it

    Everytime I throw you something

    You look at mine and compare it

    Man, it''s a cold shame

    But it''s a cold game

    I ain''t make the rules to this game

    Look, all I know and all I do

    Is try to come through with something new

    Banging for you

    So whatever you do, you like it or not

    Because when your shit play out

    I be back on the dope spot

    My grandpappy once sat me in his lap and he said

    "son get your money like that" (get your money, man)

    I sit alone in the zone

    Face of stone

    Live the live of al capone

    A don corleone

    Casually casualties, fatalities

    And all kind of funny looking niggas coming after me

    Funny, it''s got me dodging, dipping, slipping, and sliding

    Eastside up, eastsiders cause we riding (eastside up)

    This is portable something to f**k with your ear

    Doggy dogg will appear to make it sound so clear

    I f**ks it up, like I always do

    And that''s a trick

    I''m saying some shit

    To make the bitches want to suck my dick

    See it''s an everyday thang

    Communicating to y''all with the dogg pound slang

    Back up in the house and we just don''t stop

    Call ya mama, f**k her fat, call the motherf**king cops

    Hit roccs, yeah, you know what? you know what

    They told me like this

    Throughout the streets of Long Beach

    The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts

    Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young

    Youth behaviour is outrageous with crime

    They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements

    Have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs

    From coming into our country, but they can''t

    The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount

    Of which they make is more than 700 million dollars

    Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion

    From knives to guns,from the rich to the slums

    We ran outta dope,I don''t think so son

    Sha-La-La brought the orange, with the zags and the blunts

    Roll up some Bob Marley joints of some skunk, Daz with Thai

    And Nate got a hundred piece

    So we piece up properly on the O.Z

    We in the zone bombed out feelin'' good, ya know

    Got the homegirls and homies from the hood, ya know

    2-1, 1-9, 2-0, we all in the house

    And it''s a Long Beach thang where I was born and hung out

    To all my players and hustlers and gangbangers, listen up

    It''s about time I kick a rhyme to fuck shit up

    Now who throws shit?

    You might also like[Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]

    No one throws a Eastside party like we do

    Nobody...No one does it better


    [Interlude: Snoop Dogg]

    Now do the gangstas run this motherfucka? (Hell Yeah!)

    Or do the ladies run this motherfucka? (Hell Yeah!)


    [Chorus 4X: Nate Dogg]

    No one throws a Eastside party like we do

    Nobody...No one does it better


    [Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

    Now the party is bumpin'', thumpin'' back to back

    And Daz on the turntables puttin'' down a scratch (HA!)

    I''m on the mic so I''mma bust me a rap

    And I''mma dedicate this one to a pack of hoodrats

    The Dogg Pound nation, locs and big posse

    These is the peoples I see rockin'' the party

    Make a nigga wanna poplock on the flo''

    And do the Boogaloo Shrimp and pimp the ho

    I got to owe ''em my life cuz I''m a O.G

    I got the love in the hood cuz I''m the big homie

    I got the skills when it comes to rockin rhymes

    So put your hands up to the sky, get yours, I got mines

    Now everything is live, don''t you agree?

    And if you do, then keep on groovin'' with that nigga D-O-double-G

    We ridin'' with the hat to the side of the ride

    Y''all know how we do on the Eastside

    You see the thing is we like to keep it harder

    And we real party people just like Afrika Bambaataa

    What do you want? Matter fact, what do you need?

    Cuz we keep it all on point from the drank to the joint

    So pass the bottle, ain''t no need to squabble

    And hand it to the little homie, let him have a swallow

    It''s a Eastside thang, nigga, bring yo ass

    G''s up Ho''s down, nigga, you know the program

    [Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]

    No one throws a Eastside party like we do

    Nobody...No one does it better


    [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]

    (What you watchin'' the clock for?) The clock tickin''

    But it won''t stop kickin'' cuz everybody kickin'' it

    And gettin at the bitches, which is, the main thing gangstas do

    Skip the bump cuz the rump''s what I came to view

    New pussy in the hood, shall I kill it? (Kill It!)

    The way she got it poppin, no, it''s probably hotter than a skillet

    But baby don''t tweak, like you ain''t no freak, peep

    I keep my game tight, it ain''t no leaks

    So we can keep this on the down low

    And take a walk with the Dogg and lemme show you what the pound for

    Candlelight and romancin''

    If I can just get the last dance in at the mansion


    [Chorus 5X: Nate Dogg]

    No one throws a Eastside party like we do

    Nobody...No one does it better


    [The Ladies]

    No one throws a Eastside party like we do

    Nobody...No one does it better'
  Eat A Dick: '[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    It''s like everywhere I look and everywhere I go

    I''m hearing muthafuckas tryna steal my flow

    But it ain''t no thang, cause see my nigga Coolio

    Put me up on the game when I stepped in the door

    You know some of you niggas is so deceptive

    Using my styles like a contraceptive

    I hope you get burnt

    Seems you haven''t learnt

    It''s the knick-knack, patty-whack

    I still got the biggest sack!

    So put your gun away, run away, cause I''m back

    Why? hit em up, get ''em up, spit ''em up

    Now, tell me, what''s going on?

    It make me wanna holler, cause my bitches come in O-zones

    Known for break off so take off your clothes

    And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin'' hoes!

    Speaking of hoes, I kick in the doors

    Put my nuts on ya chin and the story goes


    [Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

    Why do bitch-ass niggas always talk shit

    But don''t when it''s time to get wrecked, checked, and ripped?

    I knew he was a hoe

    Ready to turn a trick and I can tell from his lips that my dick would fit

    I''ve split, gums

    You didn''t know dumb-da-ditty-dumb

    And my shit do harm so run, ring the alarm

    I thought you knew I''m looney like Tony Montana

    In the mix running shit, oops and um...

    The smoothest, coolest, rudest ya know

    On a kamikaze mission (ooh, if I can be like Snoop)

    Keep wishing, listen

    One lil, two lil, three lil G''s

    Hangin'' on the dope spot slangin'' they keys

    Four lil, five lil, six lil cops

    Leanin'' in the cut, ''bout to get popped

    Not, knowin'' I''m scopin'' on the roof

    I got my red beam, better have ya bulletproof

    Cause the light don''t miss once I put it to ya dome

    They got my homies jacked, now they reachin'' for they chrome

    Al Capone was a hero of mine

    I''ve shot plenty niggas and cops, so fuck one time

    Where they at? where they at? oh, they in the back

    So I gotsta take my time and make sure that my nine

    Get him, got him, spot him, shoot him, he''s shot

    And now they call me Snoop Gotti

    I''m like a fugitive, Harrison Ford

    Slidin'' in the Chevy now the shit''s gettin'' heavy

    But you know I can''t choke so I call my nigga Loc

    Gotta find the hideaway and a big bag of smoke

    Can''t be fuckin'' wit'' my niggas while they makin'' they dope

    Cause if ya slippin'', ya fallin'' asleep on Death Row


    [Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

    Now some muthafucka done snitched on me

    And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century

    I''m mobbin'' through the county main line

    Back in 9500, just tryna handle mines

    Spittin'' game at my homies about the good ol'' days

    As we try to pass time, waitin'' for the chains

    To Chino, I see no reason to cry

    When a nigga''s still alive, right?

    Five o''clock wake up, call roll, call Doggy Dogg

    Be at the chow hall from there I roam the yard

    Still representin'' to the fullest, so you know what time it is

    I shank a nigga in a minute, abiding rules of the pen

    I adapt quick, don''t take shit from no nigga

    Hittin'' pushups by the g''s to get bigger

    Eight months, I''m on swole, my mind''s clearer

    Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror

    And guess what the fuck I''m startin'' to see

  Freaky Tales: 'Artist: Snoop Doggy Dogg

    Album:  In Tha Beginning... There Was Rap

    Song:   Freaky Tales


    These are the tales, the freaky tales

    These are the tales that I tell so well

    These are the tales, the freaky tales

    These are the tales that I tell so well

    I met this girl, her name was Joan

    She loved the way I rocked on the microphone

    When I met Joan, I took her home

    She was just like a doggie all on my bone

    I met another girl, her name was Ann

    All she wanted was to freak with a man

    When I met Ann, I shook her hand

    We ended up freakin by a garbage can

    The next young freak, I met was Red

    I took her to my house and she gave me head

    She like blowin dicks, is all she said

    We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed

    There''s another girl, her name is Sherry

    You talk about sex and the girl acts scary

    I heard she was freakin from my big brother Jerry

    Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry

    Young and tender, sweet Denise

    Get her in the bed and the girl''s a beast

    I tell you homeboy if you get a piece

    She''ll only start talkin bout signin a lease

    I met a young tender, her name is Lori

    An X-Rated movie wouldn''t tell her story

    She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa

    And just like Lori she''s a real dick pleaser

    My girlfriend''s name, was Michelle

    Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale

    When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well

    Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell

    I G''d this girl, her name was Tammi

    I didn''t wanna do it cause the bitch was ?flantly?

    She had a best friend, her name was Janet

    I pulled her to the side and I spit that game

    I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan

    I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam

    The very next day, I saw her with her man

    One week passed, and I was in her again

    I had an old tender, her name''s Jeanine

    She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen

    She likes to freak, she''s just a fiend

    It really didn''t matter when I saw her in jeans

    I want a big freak, fat and sloppy

    I kick on back, and watch the ho just mop me

    Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta

    A country broad from Alabama

    I met this freak, her name was Beth

    Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death

    I was tired as Hell, I was drippin sweat

    But I was all up in her tryin to hold my breath

    Bake, and, shake, ups

    I met this freak in Vegas

    She she said her name was Don-na

    She was a ?belt? lil'' freak from Chi-na

    I said, "I don''t pimp, or gigolo

    I''m havin so much paper I don''t need a ho

    You can break yourself, but you can''t break me

    You never met a player like Snoop baby"

    I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe

    I took her to my house and we did it on the flo''

    The girl got freaky let me tell you mo''

    She was down on her knees, beggin to blow

    She''s like another freak, named Renee

    You get her all alone and she''ll make your day

    Like Burger King, she knows the play

    And with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way

    These are the tales, the freaky tales

    These are the tales that I tell so well

    These are the tales, the freaky tales

    These are the tales that I tell so well!You might also lik'

    I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes

    What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money

    You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin'' way too funny

    What the fuck''s goin on wit you niggas, y''all tryin to play a low pro

    And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it

    I guess it''s time for me to act just like an alcoholic

    And step to the game, I''m a stumble in like I don''t know

    And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I''m takin off from the get-go

    I ain''t givin no room to try to get me first

    Cos I done been bombed on before and I''mma tell you, man, that''s the worst

    Fifth in the world, but I''mma keep my thang together

    Cos I''mma keep makin money and hope everything is still together

    Havin papers, man, now what y''all niggas doin?

    All y''all broke on the corner

    Drinkin your drink, wanna be doin what I''m doin

    But don''t get mad and don''t be tryin to play-hate

    Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state

    Representin, uhh, what y''all wanna represent

    But y''all can''t represent it cos y''all got no dollars, no cents

    I''m movin on, groovin on and I''m movin

    Makin more moves than the average Cuban

    Tryin ta get G''s across the town, tryin ta make more hits

    And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch

    Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do''

    Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce

    And she wants to jump in, bring a friend

    Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in

    Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac

    It''s on me, I''m feelin good tonight

    I ain''t lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I''m get caught

    And I can''t get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support

    Great scotts, it''s hot today

    He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest

    He fell to the floor with his hands in the air

    His vision gettin blurry but you know I didn''t care

    Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck

    So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck

    Shooting like a muthafuckin Vietnam vet

    Riding on this nigga disrepectin my set

    No stranger to danger ain''t no warning shots

    On the hood gettin hot, anybody can drop

    You better have a spot up in town my nigga

    Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga

    Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat

    Grease strikes you out with no get back

    Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat

    And your bitch ain''t shit the little homie hit that

    Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me

    Let''s go get a stick nigga dip with me

    We can ride on some niggas for nuthin at all

    Even if we cool with ''em, fuck ''em let''s go get ''em

    LBC in this muthafucka cuz

    I had to show these niggas what time it was

    We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns

    We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves

    Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip

    Or better yet, strapped a clip

    To a muthafuckin'' nine millimeter for heater

    And put the ride down out of G two seater

    You need a nigga like me to get your game like that

    Young nigga, you could get a smack for that

    I''m that nigga who brought the afro back

    And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack

    Before I came out niggas was wearing slack

    I brought the curl back and the golf hat

    The black poker sack and this scandalous raps

    The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks

    I brought snaps to the game nigga

    Raps to the game nigga, I''m that big rap name nigga

    S-N double O-P fa sho

    I do my thang way cutthroat on the down-low

    Oh once upon a time in the LBC

    There lived a OG from the DPG

    And all the little kids looked up to him

    All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him

    But couldn''t do nothing to him cause he''s like stainless steel

    And all they hated on him because he was way to real

    I don''t know why but he''s just so fly

    [Mac Minista]

    Mac Minista in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg

    The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit

    In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against

    My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 counts

    Of flexing his G''s, popping his P''s

    Dotting his I''s and crossing his T''s

    The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit

    In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against

    My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts

    Of verbal and reckless endangerment

    From the million dollar mouthpiece;

    And leaving these super-sap suckers

    Discombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice

    The anti-player, has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit

    In the Game Court. Charging my client Snoop Dogg

    Tha Doggfather - for distributing and manufacturing game

    Crossing state and county lines, with the intent to pimp the system

    Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather

    Bring him before 12 G''s and open up his files

    And you will see, that ever since Snoopy was a pup

    His tail was straight up - ready to shake rattle and roll

    And charge from a ho to a henchman about his pension

    So all you jerks with them $11 words

    Comin out of your $2 mouth

    About a multi-million dollar Crip

    Who''s got the mind of a bid''ness man, the heart of a tyrant

    And the tongue of a mack - I said

    He''s a five-star guerilla Crip, with bars and stars

    While you suckers is lookin for stripes

    His game is as sharp as a mosquito''s needle;

    And with this in mind, I''m gonna ask the Game Court

    To grant a motion, of 995 - grounds, of dismissalYou might also lik'

  "Gangbangin\u2019 101": '[Intro: Snoop Dogg]

    West Coast, it''s time to stand up nigga

    We gon'' unite ''round this motherfucker one time

    I''m callin'' every real Crip nigga

    And every real B-Dogg, to the table right now

    Yeah, we gon'' push a real line right now

    See if y''all with this real gangsta guerrilla shit


    [Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    Have you ever seen 100,000 rip riders from the side

    Blue Chuck''s, blue rags, grey clouds, blue skies

    On the move, can''t lose, Hill Street blues

    Niggas gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray

    These suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news

    She shook up, look up and then she put me on the move

    I tried to get away, but I couldn''t get far

    ''Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park

    And I got into a squab, got caught and went to jail

    Straight to the County with no motherfuckin'' bail

    4800 with this Crippin'', oh well

    My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail

    He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right

    Eyes open cause niggas get stuck on seez-ight

    It ain''t no motherfuckin'' problem - pop-pop, tick-tock

    Never flip-flop, 20 crippin'' til I drop

    Ca-rip


    [Verse 2: The Game]

    Is I, in the motherfuckin'' S-5

    With the red bandana double knotted ''round the rearview

    Niggas see clear through, they know that it''s Game

    Cherry red Lowenhart''s let ''em know that I bang

    So bang, like Snoop in "Deep Cover"

    I got the seat reclined, fo-five under the white-T, smothered

    Dippin'' down Green Leaf, I ain''t got no enemies

    Been shot five times, now I bleed Hennessy

    And bang for my niggas locked up, they can''t stop us

    It ain''t a gangsta party ''til we go and dig Pac up

    I''m Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on

    Hughey P. Newton with Air Force One''s on

    I gangbang but I''m the opposite of Tookie Williams

    Red Lambo'', red bandana print ceilin''

    Me and Snoop got the West Coast locked

    Red and blue rag tied in a knot

    With all my motherfuckin'' homies yellin'' out

    [Verse 3: The Game]

    I ran outta gas in Long Beach, I''m stuck

    Ain''t no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck''s

    Hopped out the ''6-trey, nowhere to go

    Til'' Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steeler ''6-4

    We just dippin'', one Bloodin'' one Crippin''

    I''m on that Bulls shit, throwback Scott'' Pippen

    Moral is, my bandana hangin'' from the left side

    So if you ain''t a Crip or a Blood, just throw up Westside


    [Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]

    (What up Blood?) Yeah cuz, we just tippin''

    Me and Game doin'' thangs, switchin'' lanes, Hurricanes on my feet

    Stop, and C-Walk to the beat

    Game, take the wheel and turn on 21st Street

    Eastside LBC, gun in my hand

    It''s the turf by the surf but we don''t play in the sand

    We just - slip and slide out, we rip and ride out

    Let it C known, nigga welcome to the Thunderdome

    [Chorus]

    I had my double pointin'' at his window

    Right then, I knew I had to smoke his ass

    He kept rollin, I jumped in the bucket

    We couldn''t catch him, so I said fuck it

    Then we headed right back to Snukes

    Sweatin'' all the bitches in the Daisy Dukes

    We couldn''t no play, from the ladies

    With seven niggas in a Navs, bitch you crazy?

    She was scared and it was showin''

    Like some pussy, or in fact

    Gettin'' rowdy, shit but we call it rat pack

    On a nigga follow nothin'' at all

  Gangstaz Life: '[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    10-20-71, the day I come out

    Two days later, I''m runnin'' my mouth

    Mom''s put a bottle to my grill

    I look her in the face and I say chill

    So she puts her back up on a pillow

    Five minutes later I''m bailin'' out the hoes-pital

    On my way to the liquor store

    The first thing I grab is some skins and a 4-0

    Dropped the O-E cause it''s just too cold

    I get myself some gin instead and then I stroll

    But before I get out the door

    The man behind the counter says hey, yo, yo

    He picks me up and sit me on the seat

    And then he grabbed the phone and get to dialin'' the police

    I wanna run but I can''t walk yet

    Can''t grapple with nothin'' said, cause I can''t talk yet

    First trip in the police car

    Cameras all around me as if I was a star

    Young black toddler, it''s feeling like they dissin'' me

    Mom''s grabbed me, and then she gets to kissin'' me

    She thanks the police for my good health

    I don''t know why, I coulda done that by my muthafuckin'' self

    And I always love my mama cause she raised me right

    And I must say that I''m a gangsta

    [Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

    Let''s speed the clock up and pass some time

    June 17th, 1979

    That''s my first time being arrested

    I know I done the crime, but I ain''t going to confess to this shit

    I learned that from the G''s

    A G is a overseer, the overseer sees

    More than you do cause he gets experience

    And besides I''m just a juvenile delinquent

    ''fore I was gone, and I''m on my way home

    My momma''s coming to get me in a fleetwood brougham

    She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb

    We stop at frosty freeze for a couple of snowcones

    She telling me that I didn''t need to do what I done

    She said: "playing football should be your only fun son"

    I''m like "allright" so we head to the house

    I mobbed through the door and pops fired to the mouth

    I couldn''t do nothing but cry like a bitch

    I looked at my momma and said: "damn, why you snitch?"

    They put me on punishment but that didn''t work

    Now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a t-shirt

    And throwing up the neighborhood gang signs

    I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time

    5 feet, 6 wearin'' 83

    They sent me to a place called LP

    I bailed in the dorm lookin'' hard as hell

    I told ''em who I was and where I dwell

    Some fool had beef and he ran up on me

    Hear nothin'' pop cause I spotted one of my homies

    Who ran the game to me in the correct manner

    And told me to stay down for my bandana

    Two weeks later, I''m getting shipped to another institution

    I''m fucking up, starting confusion

    Vibed on my counselor, feeling like a champ

    I finally get settled down at the junior fine camp

    I do my little time up in this home sweet home

    My momma''s coming to get me in a fleetwood brougham

    I''m on swauce, so if pops swing it''s on

    But things did change, why?, cause pops ain''t home

    Why? he couldn''t take it, what? so he moved on out

    Left my momma the car, the kids, the bills, and the house

    That''s half of my life summoned up

    That''s why young, black teens in the ghetto don''t be comin'' up

    The way their ancestors did

    Because mom plays the role of both parents to the kids

    But when you make it, your father, he shows up shortly

    But when thangs ain''t right, they play the role like they don''t know me

    But when you play me like that ya see

    I have no other choice but playin'' the role of a G

    [Bridge: Snoop Dogg]

    This is a gangsta''z life

    Straight gangsta''z life


    [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]

    I''m full grown, out on my own

    But my impression is still at my momma''s home

    My baby brother, guess what y''all? he wanna be like me

    They call him lil Snoop Dogg and he way more harder than I was

    A hog, been through YA, nellaz, and all the hogs

    He even robbed santa claus on Christmas day

    And every Sunday my momma pray that he don''t get caught up in gunplay

    Hey, I made the bed so I guess I gotta lay

    I guess I''ll slide through and ride through the hood today

    Lay low, hold ya gats, and watch yaself

    Stay composed, I freeze-frozed clothes, doze on O''z

    Muthafuckas who be lovin'' a cup of shit of shit up

    All they wanna do is show another nigga lit up, hit up

    Names of the homies who rest in peace

    Ya got your stars on wit'' ya flag, and ya khakis properly creased

    Mobbin'' through the way or should I say

    Strollin'' through the park one day

    Sippin'' on the Hen do'' sad''n a muthafucka

    Cops raid my house, they shot my baby brother

    They say he was strapped but they never found a strap

    This life of a gangsta, he''ll never get back

    And it''s like that

  Gold Rush: '[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    Josey Wales was known for robbin'' trains and banks

    Layin everybody down for diamond rings and chains

    It remains the same in the year you live in, see

    ''Cause if I pull out some heat, nigga, you''ll go kick in

    And that''s just the rules set by the fool from the ol'' school

    When it''s time to duel, you get two men

    Two heaters, one street, one clock

    And when it strike twelve one of y''all gon'' drop

    If you''re quick on the draw

    You''re gon'' see the morgue

    But if you''re too slow

    I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)

    Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit''s real

    I ain''t no John Wayne, these niggas gangbang

    The Four Horsemen, that''s the click I''m wit

    You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers

    Yeah, we''re on a mission ta Kansas, slippin thru Texas

    We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes

    Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg

    Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses

    The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen

    Searchin for this location on the map

    The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)

    It feels just like it''s 1865

    And a trigger look-a-day is how I ride

    You might also like[Verse 2: Kurupt]

    On and on and on it''s more strange

    Time to heat, shootin range

    Quick with the heat on their hip

    Young Jesse James come to test your aim

    I seen you at th e Wild Horny Corral

    I hearda ya name

    Tha forcify, nigga you ain''t never lie

    Besides I''m in the mood so at high noon we ride

    From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach

    My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts

    The off-the-rocker roller coaster

    On a six-shooter holster

    With DPG on every Wanted poster

    Let me think about which bank to gank

    Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank

    I want all the shit you got in stacks

    Attached to this skirt in the corner

    So I snatched the bitch in the back

    The Dogg in me feels for the lust

    But the hogg in me makes me wanna bust

    Back to the drawin down board

    Nowadays we drawn down more

    To survive thru all the round wards

    Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene

    Or get''cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen

    I can''t help it, I''m heartless, ya can''t hack it

    With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket

    Like that cock back

    Quick to pull my strap

    Just to put the Horsemen on the map

    (The gold rush)

    [Verse 3: Techniec]

    Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots

    I got the six shots for all the plans and plots

    I gots lots o'' cash stashed in money bags

    Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags

    I got stacks so my stacks excell

    Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells

    I''m on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse

    A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o'' course

    It ain''t no stoppin young Josey

    Box all the nosey

    Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hoes be

    Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell

    Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele

    Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet

    Divide between my homies and ride the sunset


    [Verse 4: Bad Azz]

    Two sacks o'' money from the train heist

    They ain''t even counted it up

    Just mounted it up

    Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster

    Pass thru a run-down town whose walls hold my poster

    Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat

    So I gotta have what I can get

    Heard word about the gold rush and headed West

    On my white horsey with three straps in my napsack

    Giddy up, the next town I rode thru

    I had to threaten to blow their city up

    Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west

    Sell us some beads and hail us some weed

    He offered me a toke

    He didn''t have a 20 he had they peace-pipe smoke

    I almost choked

    Break him for the get, right, I''m off into the sunset

    Tryin ta reach my destiny fast

    It''s these two bags o'' cash

    44''s cocked I ain''t makin no mo'' stops

    Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot

    I slid off my boots, counted my loot

    Five minutes after the strike of midnight

    I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight

    (At the gold rush, at the gold rush

    At the gold rush, at the gold rush

    At the, at the, at the)4'

    The life I used to live, I had to leave it alone

    ''Cause my backbone was ''bout to get it alone

    What''s a man to gain the world and not share?

    Everything I went through helped me prepare

    For the day that I talk like this

    And I''m sure that Jesus walked like this

    It''s a fact though, exacto

    Rewriting my rap flow

    Come as you are, I''m posted up at the backdoor

    Church panic, I''ll be making the plans

    Kissing their babies and shaking their hands

    Man, God gave me my life back then He brought my wife back

    I''m suited and booted, praising His name

    Through my trials and tribulations, I''m grateful for everything

    [Verse 1]

    Too hippy to be cut-throat - hippies blow the best smoke

    Rollin'' up RAWs and living royal

    All my and bays & jays is loyal, they won''t leave me cause I spoil

    The baddest of them all, the hash is why I won''t fall

    Molasses can''t match my crawl, I''m higher than all of y''all

    They sayin'' they born to ball, I''m sayin'' I''m Santa Claus

    Funny jokes I tell all, always inhale fog

    Nappy dreads, my hair long - Diamond 5-foot bong

    Could never be a clone...


    [Hook]


    [Verse 2]

    We ballin'', it''s all we know, it''s not an option

    You see us, and yes, we poppin''

    Standin'' tall, we not fallin''

    I come through with the humps, I''ll thump the shit out your block

    I''m on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop

    Spotted some hoes, tooted my horn at the bitch

    The Riviera skated, my interior''s the shit

    Fifteens humpin'', dropped the top some more

    Countin'' my doe, purchased 250 of some bomb indo

    Floss through South Central, I''m on my way to the Eastside

    We high, blazin'' like crazy and don''t know why

    Feelin'' good as fuck, on a hot ass day

    And there''s a pool jam right around the way

    Niggas got hoes, but ladies in the world

    They wanna play with their minds like little girls

    I twirl my fingers in the air, run my fingers through my hair

    Redbones to blackbones, darkbones to Redbones

    Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen

    But I play hoes like Plenty Lenny cause I get pretty

    It''s all about game...

    Cause with no game is hard to maintain, for so long man

    From Long Beach, California

    From Tul-sa, Oklahoma

    Tonight boardin'' New Orleans from Mississippi

    I know you hold the key to unlock the door

    From low pro''s she rolls with gold thangs, we ridin'' fo'' sho''

  Hater N You: '(Sycamore)


    [Intro]

    Hey- Hey, man, check this out, mane

    It''s Big Snoop coming at you live and direct, and Imma speak on some real issues
    right now, mane

    ''Cuz motherfuckers be hatin'' on a real nigga like me, and I don''t do nuthin''
    but do what I''m supposed to be doin'', you know what I''m sayin''?

    But I don''t crack a plank and say "nigga, why you hatin'' on me?" or try to,
    you know, make friends with motherfuckers who don''t wanna be my friends

    Motherfuck you ain''t, you bitch ass nigga!


    [Verse 1]

    I guess it''s the thing

    Now, they used to hate on us

    Pull out your cannon, come through, and spray on us

    Laying the cut, but Dogg can see a mutt

    You know, that''s just how I used to fuck with the big old butt

    You think I ain''t know? You ain''t had to tell me, cuz

    I appreaciate the love, but you know how it was

    Man, I really couldn''t, even though I probably should do it

    Slap the bitch and put some hot cap into it

    She didn''t know I knew it

    She used to fuck with that bitch nigga Suge in ''96 and ''97

    My young homeboy from the LPT

    You know I''m high and connected with some niggas from the CPT

    So when the hate is on, I get the message faster than y''all

    Step into my reppin'' I keep my weapon revolved

    I keep the problems resolved

    I''ve been finessing these broads

    I love breaking Suge Knight and his bros (Ha ha)

    Just like breaking the laws

    I used to have his baby momma like taking it off

    I''m taking it all

    Lil'' nasty bitch was licking my balls

    She''s taking it all

    And you can''t do nothin'' ''bout it ''cuz she breaking me off

    Keep the bitch nuttin'', so it really was nothin''

    I said, fuckin'' it up

    You might also likeYou''s a hater, bitch nigga!

    Remember! I''m the one that make you rich, nigga


    [Verse 2]

    And I started from scratch, and put you back on the map

    And I ain''t lookin'' back, but I keep hearing shit from your staff

    I giggle and laugh (ha ha ha ha ha), cuz you said you can''t stand me

    Your whole rap label is a disfunctional family (family)

    And then you try to hate on me

    ''Cuz I''m straight blowing up

    I''m banging on your bitch ass and two O''s is what I''m throwing up

    I seen you at BET, with the homies from the LBC (Whaddup!)

    You broke down ''cuz you didn''t want to see me (Huh? What''s happenin''?)

    It''s so easy

    To crack you

  Hoop Dreams (He Got Game): 'Man I had a crazy crazy dream dogg

    I had a dream I was in the NBA straight playin basketball

    NBA straight getting my ball on dogg

    Can you imagine?

    Snoop Dogg in the NBA?

    Imagine that, Hoop Doggy Dogg

    Yea straight ballin

    You know I''m a ball anyway so why not

    Let me get my ball on


    If I could play in the NBA

    I would be that six-four all day shootin that trey

    I dribbled to the outside and passed it to Shaq

    They double teamed on him so he passed it back

    Look at the 3 but I don''t take the shot

    Cause I think I''m cold and I ain''t trying to get hot

    I''m feelin bionic, we playing the Sonics

    And I''m sticking Gary Payton so you know I''m ball hatin

    Bang on Vin Baker cause real Lakers really don''t care yea yea

    Next stop in the court on Damon toast Stouda and my homeboy J.R. Rider

    Minnesota Timberwolves, we cut ''em down

    Hakeem Olajuwon and Scottie Pippen, we shut ''em down

    The Twin Towers, Dave and Duncan

    20 in the paint fool you get''s nothing

    On a four game roll sweep, beep beep

    We beat the Bulls and we rocked the Heat

    And we traded for a few players, some Pacers

    Miller and Mullin and now they Lakers

    We can''t be beat now, we on a 27 game win streak now, bow wow

    When it all started from a dream

    I''m playin point guard on my favorite team (Lakers)

    I got the big perm, doing interviews with Chick Herm

    At Stu Lance, we do a dance

    When it rains poppin shampane

    Basketball yes yall thats the game

    Two years ago a friend of mine

    Ask me to glide from the free throw line

    So I took the ball, and as I made the hoop

    Everybody jumped up and they said "Go Snoop"

    And my career jumped off into the fast lane

    My rookie season I made my first all star game

    Double G like George Gervin, thats what the call me cause I''m so ice

    Ballin cause that''s my life, I balls all day, and I balls all night

    They call me Snoop Dogg and everybody know I love to hustle and ball

    The season gettin tragic we lost to the Magic

    And the word is that Rodman done had it

    So I guess it on a young homie, the great number 8, Mr. Kobe

    Give him the ball dogg he ready

    We got to play Charlotte tonight, I''m stickin Eddie

    Remember all the good times that we had

    Cuz dont trip to long cause tommorow we play the Jazz

    Then it on to play the Denver Nuggets

    The homeboy Nick they traded, but damn I still love ''em

    Keep a picture of ''em on the wall next to Dr. J

    Meach, I love basketball

    Allen Iverson on the fly boy he hard to stick

    C Webb comin through with a quick pick

    The NBA Saturday mornings hey or maybe on a Sunday

    We in the playoffs so stay off the court

    This ain''t no game, this a sport

    And we in it to win it, we ballin, No Limit

    Remember this

    When I grow up on wanted to be a point guard playing on NBC

    With Herb and Suge or Pistol Pete or World B. Free givin dap to me

    Givin up my dues with converse shoes

    And tellin all the kids to stay in school

    This is true and your dreams can come true

    If it happen to me, it can happen to you

    Deleted my SoundCloud

    {I love, to give you light)


    [Intro: Snoop Dogg]

    Geah, first of all

    Givin honor to God, and all the ministers on the pulpits

    Ushers, deacons, and my lovely choir

    They sound so beautiful, don''t you agree?

    Yeah, we''d like to welcome y''all inside this R&G

    Rhythm & Gangsta: The Masterpiece

    Such a, heavenly experience

    Alchemist, break it down for me nephew

    Let me preach to ''em one time, chuuch


    [Snoop Dogg]

    In the beginning as a child I was chosen

    Though not knowin the reason while still my eyes opened

    Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog

    Love was given to all, outside livin the ball

    As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message

    To reach teachin the masses, I wrote my first passage

    It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap

    I''m young, livin in the city of jackers and gangbangin

    And dope dealin, cold feelin to be a product of niggas around you

    Once you get on top they down you

    But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin

    I found myself grindin on the streets quite often

    With a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo''-fifth coffin

    At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside

    Where most of the big homies had a Glock and flossed the G-ride

    Niggas throwin up hands but it wasn''t no peace signs

    Never fo'' a second did I think to let my light shine

    Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin up

    Disrespectin my home, not carin ''bout what moms what sayin

    And then I found out that mom wasn''t playin

    Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn''t understand

    Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man

    Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with

    Through the stripes still gotta shine my light

    I''ve grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg

    Just a block and a phone call away

    I''ve reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist

    I''m preachin just what I practice

    To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to acros the globe

    Man woman young and old

    Don''t gain the world, lose your soul to spite

    Many circumstances Doggy gon'' shine my light cause I love you

    But uh, it''s true

    It''s hard to get with somebody once they gone (I miss that bitch)

    [E. White]

    I got my eyes wide open

    The whole time I''m holding on to hope with you on my mind

    It''s been a while child, I''m getting down with Dogg

    I bet my name all around your wall

    Perhaps I went to jail

    That left us out of touch

    Shoulda shot some mail or something

    Ain''t no telling where she at now

    I be God damn

    Baby I really wanna see what you got now

    I''m all grown up with my shit together

    How could you do this to me (I miss that bitch)


    [Snoop]

    My momma got mad

    I was young when I hooked up with her

    One hit and I couldn''t stop trippin

    A long lasting relationship

    Pass you around, and let my niggas take a hit

    I used to break you down just to roll you up

    You the real, you never will slow me up

    And you was always on my mind

    Say no more

    I still miss you at times

    All of a sudden you lost my interest

    I packed it up and set about my business

    You used to have a hold on me

    Sometimes to the point that they said you controlled me

    I kept going to jail and all that

    Get out, fuck with you again, I''m right back

    I guess I had to learn the hard way baby

    I''m leaving you alone cause you driving me crazy (I miss that bitch)

    Who bigger than me? Shit, yeah, I said it

    Who did it like me? Who want the dice? Nigga, bet it

    20 plus years, I ain''t even gotta sell it

    I ain''t even got to show up to get the money

    Mail it, I''m going in


    [Bridge: Snoop Dogg]

    Battlecat, what you gon'' do?

    Hoes recognize, niggas do too

    Long Beach, East Side mad-ass lunatics

    Still own niggas who talk bitch shit

    Down for whatever, whoever wanna see me now

    Slap a bitch nigga out to get a grip

    Take a whole lot to be Snoop D-O-dub

    You gotta put it down and always stay G''d up


    [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]

    Who did it like a muhfuckin'' legend?

    Yeah, it hurts, church, reverend

    Sat back, took a look at me, shit''s classic

    Pocket full of paper, the haters, they can''t grasp it

    Still at the top of my game, I''m all-pro

    Lost count of the cars, nigga, they all show

    I got a family to feed, now that''s growth

    But I''ll still lay your ass out for the low

    Now, grown men make it hard to trip

    I''m talking big dick shit, man, it''s hard to grip

    Got a whole gang of albums and some major flicks

    I got a wife, rich life, that''s some major shit

    [Chorus: Snoop Dogg]

    Bigg Dogg, yeah, I said it

    Who did it like me? Who want the dice? Nigga, bet it

    20 plus years, I ain''t even gotta sell it

    I ain''t even got to show up to get the money

    Mail it, I''m going in


    [Outro: Battlecat]

    Used to be out West, but now you hear me

    From the LBC, around the room, let''s blow this smoke

    Used to be out West, but now you hear me

  I Will Survive: '[Technique]

    By dawn''s early light

    I shine brighter than the stars in the night

    And ''bout ready for a fight

    Come noon, I''ve consumed enough juice

    To cut loose and throw a mic to the moon

    Since I''m the sun, I''ll make you one, it''s all for fun

    I''m torching hot and all the same

    From playing war games with Saddam Hussein

    Now who''s sane? I''m insane, my membrane''s on cold-grown

    The tempature''s rising, to fry the cells in your dome

    It might be on, and if you think so, you know me

    It''s Tech Caponey, the Doggfather''s little homey


    [Snoop Doggy Dogg]

    Ain''t that somethin'', how I got little homeys now?

    I remember when I was just a little bow-wow

    Writing for my rep, calling ''fore I step

    Now I put niggas in the game just to stay on deck

    High profile, but my style low-pro

    Top dogg on the Row, Doggystyle C.E.O

    And I blow the best indo, that you know of

    So when I''m in your town, dip down, and show love

    You know what? What''s up? Shit, I''m feeling good now

    You better come and get me ''fore I fall into a freestyle

    You might also like[Technique]

    They say, what''s a rapper? Well nigga, what''s an emcee?

    If they don''t got the skills, then they don''t roll with me

    Ain''t that the truth?, I''m bulletproof off the roof

    I got a mic and a fix, that''ll jack you for your tooth

    I''m out for rep, but how long will it last?

    I''m coming up quick, cause broke niggas need cash

    At last, I''m at the top, so I maintain now

    Gotta bang now, nigga this Doggystyle


    [Snoop Doggy Dogg]

    All she ever wanted was a small time, love thang

    Got my homey caught up in the dope game, coke game

    He so sprung, on top of that he young

    He''s only thirteen years old, and the world''s so cold

    He never took the time-out to fall down on his knees

    Until he fucked his G, got some keys, now they''s enemies

    The niggas he grew up with, they put him in the game

    Now they ''bout to take him out the game

    Man it''s a shame, but you know how that shit go

    That''s life in the fast lane, that''s why I roll slow


    [Hook]: Kurupt,(Snoop), [*some singing in the backgound*]

    I''d rather not get shot

    I''d rather sit in the studio and rock spots

    Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, we''re one big family, it''s all D.P.G. (D.P.G.)

    I got a G on the best bomb money can buy

    I ain''t out for no homicides, I''m out to survive

    Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, one big family, it''s all D.P.G. (D.P.G.)

    [Technique]

    (Niggas) Niggas and hoes will try to get you twisted

    But I''m unlisted in the books

    You base your life on that, you might get your life took, BLAOW!

    Put me in the game, I''m riding hard ''til I win

    Serve a crew, kill a few niggas, ''til the end

    I mean, I''m a fiend for superior green

    And all my life I got advice from a superior team

    I gotta stay away from the casket

    Don''t get blasted, and tell my kids how I lasted

    But my crew''s mafioso, so my philoso-

    Phy is to G to the day that I d-i-e [*echoes*]

    Wake up every morning to my Lucky Charms cerials

    Time''s getting drastic, man I''m a flas it

    Dogg Pound Gangstas'' choking off that boombastic

    Have you ever heard?

    I''m loose, shook the feds, like the juice, Snoop Dogg is 121st proof

    I''m a genuwine, like ??, and all about cash, cash

    Cash, I got some free, so indeed I gets the lighter for the hash

    Has it ever been a time when you didn''t have a dime

    Yeah, gangsta, uh-huh!

    Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty

    Black female with chips, from the city?

    Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends

    And she liked to give me ends when I''m out with my friends

    Good girl - why do good girls like bad boys? (I don''t know)

    When I was a kid, growin up, I never had toys

    And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)

    Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up

    Shit, she''d take a nigga out

    Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look

    Baby was my thang, nah, she was my low-low

    Bought my first Rol-o, and then we took a photo together

    Man I hope this thang last forever

    We been together six months, and we ain''t argued yet

    She lovin a nigga, steady buyin me shit

    And don''t say shit when I dip with my click

    And understand, when I''m down and out

    May need some help with some chips

    Her mother approved of me, but her father he don''t

    He probably won''t, shit Pops ain''t no punk

    Daddy''s little girl be in a gangsta''s world

    Buyin me houseshoes and khaki blues, California curls

    No matter what her father say, baby gon'' see me

    It''s like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie

    In love with a thug

    And hope she don''t get caught up in the world that''s so crazy

    But while I''m up in Wayside, and she off in college

    She gettin a little mo'' than a schoolgirl knowledge

    Cause gangsta-ass niggas go to school nowadays

    I tried to make you wait, but I can''t change yo'' ways

    She fell in love with the local G

    And now they both in the penitentiary, she didn''t mention me

    So all that straggling in the gate trying to get close to me

    Ya''ll niggas need to stop

    Trying to flip the hip hop scrip

    I snap, crackle and POP

    Tell your friends and foes

    It''s a whole new year and situation and I''m still hating hoes

    Will it ever stop?

    Look I really don''t know but on the up, I doubt that, lo

    Now what about your hood?

    Man, I''m doing mine they''re doing their''s

    So I guess It''s all good

    And, what about your crew?

    Shit, my crew is the Eastside

    Fool, I thought u knew

    Dogg Pound ain''t the same?

    Yeah, them niggas split up and did they own thang and went made their own gang

    Money is thicker than blood?

    That''s fuck up but on the real that''s how it is cuz, damn

    The world just ain''t the same?

    And come to find out these niggas crossing out my muthafucking name

    So what am I to do?

    I put it on mind continue to shine

    Everything fine

    In G-O-D we trust

    That''s why ya''ll suckers can''t "Touch us, Touch us"

    Meech u made the beat

    And you know when we get together

    Shit, we like bread and meat

    We coming with the heat

    Close your mouth cause Dogg House is definitely turning it out

    And what about the cops?

    I paid them and the ones I didn''t I slayed them, haha

    Will it ever stop?

    It''s like asking "Who is it" before a nigga even knock

    The game is here to stay?

    And I''m here to change the rules cause I''m a player that loves to play

    Did you thank the lord today?

    Think I did and on that note young loc, I''m getting ghost

    Why you tell the truth?

    Cause I''m hundred twenty proof from the turf to the roof

    And I got the stash, spot, my cash got

    Lot of motherfuckers pumpin'' police shots

    I''m not the one, nigga, you can call me the two

    Bob Marley reincarnated, pupils dilated

    Emancipated, concentrated, debated, rated, many times

    You surprised how I made it, huh? You hate it, huh?

    But you know, I ain''t even trippin''

    I''m splittin'' that swisher up, plottin'' on the come up (Yeah)

    Now that I grew up and blew up, I look back

    And thanked [thought] on these hoes, they straight to'' up, know what?

    Got interrogated for homicides, I ain''t never fold

    Sold drugs, sold pussy, ain''t never sell my soul

    Got shot, shot niggas, I been through all that shit

    Wanted Jordans back when my mama couldn''t afford them shits

    Watching her struggle made me not wanna be a civilian

    Acquired the finer things in life by being a villain

    If you ain''t played the field, you wouldn''t understand my story

    All them robberies we committed back then was mandatory (They was)

    All your niggas might not be there for you when you need them

    You gon'' find out who is who when you fighting for your freedom

    You in a gang, you''d be a fool to think everyone loyal

    My kids don''t know nothing ''bout struggling, all of them spoiled

    That''s why I do this shit, thought y''all niggas knew this shit

    If I can''t put food on they table, I''ma start shooting shit

    [Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

    When yo-yonder, we ponder, slip raindrops

    Shit don''t stop, we be rocking ''til the pain stops

    Meditate, take a hit and levitate

    Sit your ass down, boy, let me get your head straight

    Look into my eyes ''til your pupils dilate

    And if you really want that smoke, then I must annihilate

    Fly away with no one

    ''Pon my return, I''m on one

    Which leads me to plead the fifth

    On the sixth and the seventh, I was blowing an eighth

    On the ninth and the tenth, I was back in LA

    On the eleventh and the twelfth, I was in the UK

    Ask anybody, regulate it

    Separate it

    A tall glass of orange juice, concentrate it

    Spraying niggas down with the sucker repellant

    So you can smell what I''m smoking and you can see what I''m selling, nigga

    [Outro: Snoop Dogg]

    It''s in the air

    It''s everywhere

    It''s in the air

    It''s everywhere

    Ooh

    Yeah, it''s in the air

    And I''m talking ''bout love, love is in the air

    See, love is a deadly word though

    It''s a thin line between love and hate, my nigga

    See, ''cause a nigga could hate you so much, right?

    But he really love you'

    And I gripped the cane and I gripped the grain

    And I only came to spit the game

    Straight up out that Long Beach to Strong Beach

    Sneak baby in the party with that long heat

    At the wrong beach to play with

    Stay with that mossburg, that AK

    That chop-chop that whoop-whoop

  Keep It Real: '[Intro: Snoop Doggy Dogg]

    And now, our national anthem!

    It''s going down, West Coast

    A toast to the Coast, West Coast!

    I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection

    My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo

    L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest

    Here''s a toast to the coast!


    [Verse One: Mack 10]

    What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress

    Well known riders from different sides of the West

    Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we''re sticking up

    How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?

    So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs

    It''s the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s

    For the cheese we''re jab with the gift of the gab always capping

    Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?

    It''s all good, fool, so peep game if you could

    Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood

    So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise

    Two well known enemies now becoming allies

    In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way

    Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)

    But gangsters don''t dance, we hang-boogie and bang

    So it''s the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

    You might also like[Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg X2]

    We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people

    (Rock the party ya''ll) (Rock the party ya''ll) (Rock the party ya''ll)

    We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people

    (Rock the party ya''ll) (Rock the party ya''ll) (Rock the party ya''ll)

    Party people, party people; do you wanna get funky?

    Get down.. get down.. you know..


    [Verse Two: Bad Azz]

    Up jump the boogie, so I''ve jumped up with it

    We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it

    It''s a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy

    We''re all heated just in case; any of my enemies slipped in

    Tripped in, you don''t wanna own a casket this soon

    Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom

    The ladies love me cause I love myself

    I''m like an age, by no wine in time you''ll find;

    I''m at the top of the shelf

    So when you ready and you''re cracking a sip

    Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers

    Bump the rap tunes that''s as cold as the Whispers

    Fantastic, brand new in this classic

    We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked

    It''s Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right

    West Coast, East Side, for life!

    [Verse Three: Techniec]

    It ain''t no need for the fronting black, between me and you

    Reality bites, so I''ma keep it real with my crew

    I''m dangerous like Michael Dew

    My life cycle completes the last stages

    I''m more, I''m through, definitely gauges is outrageous

    Cause I was born to rock the party

    Oh! now you''re Mister Smarty because we got the show started!

    I''m cold hearted, and won''t stop what I''m revealing

    Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling

    And I''m feeling, that Vibe that represents the East

    I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease

    So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case

    Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste

    I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech

    Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set


    [Interlude: Snoop Doggy Dogg]

    That''s real, you know

    It''s getting kind funky here man, uhh..


    [Verse Four: Kurupt]

    Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique

    I can''t get enough of this gangster shit

    My name ain''t +Jeru+ and I ain''t out to +Dama-ja+

    But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they''re all amateurs

    See the opponents; disassemble the components

    Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment

    In a blink''s time, I take time in the doorway to crime

    With a criminal mind, the raw kind

    Microphones used so abusively

    You can''t fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T

    And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho

    I''m suicidal, split shit to cause a twister

    And get you twisted, you''re fucking with the unlisted

    To be specific; niggas ain''t being realistic

    I ain''t impressed, you''re about to get your chest test

    In the west; where it''s about your money and your set

    [Verse Five: Deadly Threat]

    You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow

    Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow

    Dream, on out far, pass the stars

    Your styles ain''t doper than ours

    Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more

    Y''all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors

    Wild like Ninety Days in the cage

    Cold like the Everglades, and never fades

    Me, C to the Z to the T

    Beef? Bet'' not let me catch you in the streets

    Hoo-Bang, cracked in the fast lane

    The melody by Deadly, the Dopeman


    [Outro: Snoop Doggy Dogg]

    Yeah yeah yeah, there you have it

    It''s like magic, it''s so tragic

    The West Coast, Hoo-Banging, Westside Connection, L.A. Zoo

    L-B-C Crew, and you know about the infamous D.P.G.s

    We make them freeze to their knees, real Gs

    Keep it real though!1'

    A Lannister always pays his debts


    [Verse 1]

    The line in the roads, breakers of the chains

    Sport of the lord, war of five kings

    Lords of the rock sitting on the iron throne

    Betrayal, revenge, murder, now his mind''s gone

    The trial ''bout to happen, he smile while he cracking

    For real cause he ready for that action

    Rich, wealthy and sinister

    Welcome to the house of the Lannisters


    [Hook](x2)

    Honour thy lord, swing my sword

    Servant of war

    We got the power

    Seven kingdoms strong (welcome to the house of the Lannisters)


    [Break: Joffrey]

    Kneel. Kneel before your king. KNEEL!


    [Verse 2]

    He won this game, king with the crown

    Go against Joffrey and he''ll cut your ass down

    So sick but it''s slay shit

    Debt-payers, pay your dues or you will get dealt with

    So much to see, blood in the streets

    Incest laying with your blood in the sheets

    Pop it, drop it like you wanna leave

    Honour, not much amongst these thieves

    And Doggy Dogg is upset

    I''m the last man standing cause I''m a rap vet

    Takin'' bullets, duckin'' bullets, dodgin'' bullets

    Tryna find a way to get out, don''t pull it

    Too quick and too fast, slow down

    Blunt wraps, Swishers and loose-leaf

    Now I got to go back to the crib

    And try to sneak in, I hope my gal don''t shoot me

    Thinking I''m lying, I''m trying to have a good time

    Barbecue, music, the good vibes

    Wonder should I make a call to come through with an ounce

    When damn, I got two at the house

    Now I got to make a decision

    Should I hit the back door with precision?

    Or maybe I should bum from my coffee brothers

    They be gottin'' Red Dead Redemption vision

    [Chorus: J Black & Snoop Dogg]

    I can''t believe it, believe it (Damn)

    I do this shit every time, damn (Every time)

  Legend of Jimmy Bones: '[Verse 1: RBX]

    Just then, I received a phone call, it was Morpheus

    And he said i was the one, realizing the deal Heaven done

    Turnin'' to the east and all praise the sun

    Now they blast me but they all miss

    I do my 3D dance and remain undaunted

    Then simply reverse the process

    As the hot slugs hit their chest-plate, checkmate

    Game over, you lose

    Funky, drunken monkey technique without screws

    As the sayin'' goes, if ya snooze ya loose

    And I won''t be aimin'' when the oozy ooze

    Got em'' runnin'' for the hills

    Style steady truckin'' like eighteen wheels

    Do got em'' cluckin'' like eighteen pills

    The hex flies off then all the blood spills


    [Bridge: Snoop Dogg]

    The Legend of Jimmy Bones

    Sharp as nails, tough as stones

    This ain''t based on no true story

    This the real motherfucker


    [Verse 2: RBX]

    Carry vocal tones, most definitely will

    Cause more horror than Amityville

    Get out, this my house

    Got you scared niggas don''t chew like a church mouse

    When I swing the Excalibur like highlander

    The head flies off you see thunder and lighting

    Much too late to realize your blunder

    Suddenly you hear there can only be one

    Well just X, We apply wild west tactics like turn back to back

    Take ten paces and draw, but I''m sneaky with mine

    Turn around at nine and blast you in your spine

    High ride off into the hot sunset, like the high plains drifter

    Hear me mister, no one blast with the

    When it comes to shootin'' gives up

    X marks the spot and guaranteed to lift up

    {Verse 1: KRS-One]

    Too much brrr brrr brr

    Too many people getting brrred [?]

    All you hear is brrr brrr brr in the streets

    People gripping they heat just to settle they beefs

    Now you getting chased by police

    You running to the west, running to the east

    But the problem is you under the beast

    Brr brr brr - now your brother''s deceased

    We need peace, not brrr in the streets

    The brrr in Iraq lasts for weeks

    Wack rappers, I''m crushing these creeps

    Every time I spit they get weak

    Knowledge reigns suprrreme

    I take you back to the days when the telephone used to rrring

    I''m reading the sacred script, KRS, Battlecat, Snoop in it, uh!


    [Hook: Snoop Dogg]

    Let us begin - what, where, why or when?

    Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen

    While I''m at the top, upfront getting it in

    Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in

    Blastmaster (One!), blast faster

    No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters

    Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us

    Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous

    But it ain''t no thing, telephone ring

    They don''t make ''em like they make ''em when I used to bang

    So I try to show the little homies different things

    How to diversify, and change different lanes

    Learn to read a little, exercise your brain

    Mental gymnastics, it''s a cold game

    Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn''t

    Cause all my teachers and doctors were curious to the furnace

    The honorable speaks

    Like Minister Louis Farrakhan my influence is deep

    Cause it''s truth

    What''s that? You don''t like that?

    Well we fight back. And we''ll be right back


    [Hook: Snoop Dogg]

    Let us begin - what, where, why or when?

    Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen

    While I''m at the top, upfront getting it in

    Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in

    Blastmaster (One!), blast faster

    No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters

    Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us

    Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous1'

    When I hit it from behind, if I go up in your mouth

    I might hit you in the mind, you know what I''m talkin ''bout

  May I: '[Verse 1]

    Now... who got the beat that makes ya bump?

    And who got the thump that makes ya cum?

    Well, I got the funk that makes ya bump

    So we gon funk this motherfucker right on up

    Well here''s a toast to the boogie while I step on in

    So put your lighters in the air and let the smoke kick in

    I got the motion, the potion

    And once Priest hit the groove everything is in motion

    We coastin through the neighborhood and lookin around

    And all of my homies on lock down, or either underground

    Man, I done found the only way to put mine down is to dip, skip with the homies
    from the Dogg Pound

    Sup, Bow-Wow, how my nigga feelin?

    Oh, I''m on the money mission to get a pocket full of millions

    Like Sicilians, we do it mafioso

    Doggy style, Dogg Pound, Death Row is the logo

    I do it by my lonely cause I''m true to the code

    Plus I die with the homies cause that''s all I really know

    Who started with me, who departed with me

    Through thick and thin we heartless-ass G''s

    Regardless, let''s see with bifocals, don''t try the locals

    And y''all wonder why they despise my vocals

    I Fold you like crystals, rap spittin like clips do

    When I dismiss you, me and my click, fool


    [Chorus]

    May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

    May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

    May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

    May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

    To be a high rolla, you need a pistola

    And about a half a key of some Coca Cola

    Now that I got older, I got a little colder

    And I don''t trip to get a chip off my nigga''s shoulder

    Man dreams of a gangsta, being like Cagney

    Or Bogey for Snoop Doggy

    Ain''t no follower, man, I''m a general, so when I put it down I gots to be so
    original

    I''m quick to bust, just like Daz Dillinger

    But that''s the little homie, and I''m the big homie, Snoop Don Corleone

    Spittin three words up in lightning

    As long as I''m bouncin with this I know you likin this

    Fo'' sho tho, you can''t take my photo

    I''m layin around in the DPG in a grey fo-do

    Get pushed around downtown in the back of a car

    The Double R from the dirt to the stars


    [Chorus]

    May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

    May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

    May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

    May I (may... I), may I funk with you?


    [Verse 3]

    Well in verse three, the worst see?

    After part two, know when I start the clock there be a heart, too

    And just the two of us, gonna show you how we do

    I thought you knew we bust

    I demolish, stay polished, got no time to rust

    No dividing, multiplying cause it''s never too much, like Luther

    Cause ya see ain''t no loser

    That can get the scoop on the Super Duper Snooper

    I refuse the tactics, you ain''t used to drastics

    I choose to mash like Land Cruisers

    You know I kizick the bomb digga-dee, bomb-ba-zee

    They can''t get with the D-O double G

    You know MC slash master of ceremonies

    Runnin thangs, pullin strings call me Snoop Pesci

    Lesson, blessin'', stressin'' manifest me

    Don''t wanna test me, I''m guaranteed to let it rest, see?

    [Chorus]

    For each other, ''cause we closer than brothers

    When my squad walks in

    Throw up your hands, baby, buy me a drink, stop actin'' phony

    Don''t forget to bring somethin'' for all my homies

    To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, duckin'' bullets

    Snatchin'' guns when these trick niggas pull it

    I''m makin'' things happen fast

    Ain''t no need to wait around for what never seems to come along

    Face lookin'' stupid, broke, startin'' feelin'' dumb

    I''m young but I''m a grown man

    Takin'' thangs into my own hands, I''m tryna own land

    But life''ll twist ya like a twister, get twisted with this

    It seems on but it''s off, I keep missin'' this shit

    I''m high but I try to stay focused, wide-eyed

    Lookin'' dead at the chips, I blink, they dip

    It''s hard to hang on, but I can''t let go

    Smokin'' on my last breath

    Blow out life what''s left is death

    Now I can go wrong or I can G or make a right

    Whatever way that I turn, it''s still death after life

    And if it don''t discourage me, I ain''t got nothin'' to lose

    But some thoughts that probably never turn to money to burn

    But I learn ''cause I see, and I earn ''cause I G

    But, these problems probably have a nigga gray and deceased

    At an early age so at an early stage in life

    Ich swear to God, dizzy unbusted


    [Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    You know my story

    I did a lot of balling

    Been around the world

    A lot of girls calling

    A lot of panties falling

    Out the air and on the stage

    If my life was a book

    You wouldn''t miss a page

    But none of that really matters

    When I cut my eyes and roll

    Seen her pass by

    I damn near dropped my folds

    I''m like Snoopy breathe

    Kush had me gone

    I couldn''t think straight

    Pimpin'' was all alone

    Shoulda seen her walking

    Like a model do

    If this was Twitter

    I would follow you

    Open your world to new things

    Let Doggy take your hand

    I''m seeing wedding rings

    Call Diddy lets make a band

    She got me hot

    I don''t want to leave

    I seen the world''s best

    But she''s something to see

    And now I''m on a plane

    Feeling so ashamed

    I couldn''t catch her name

    I call her Miss Everything

    You might also like[Hook]

    I keep runnin'' the tune at her

    But the numbers never got exchanged

    Every town, every city

    Got a, a Miss Everything

    Miss Everything (Miss everything)


    [Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

    You know my story

    I rocked a lot of crowds

    Sold millions of records

    I love my fans so loud

    I got a thousand cars

    And all hopes of bein''

    A real superstar

    I live super far

    But none of that really matters

    When I caught my eyes in Spain

    She walked into me

    Like you did your thing

    In that Spanish accent

    The one I love so much

    She looked like an angel

    One I wanted to touch

    I blinked my eye for a second

    And then she disappeared

    When I see that Pretty Woman

    I felt like Richard Gere

    Boss dog ain''t never been one to watch it pass

    Unless we in they room, and they leave

    And I watch that ass

    But baby something else

    Somehow I didn''t speak

    I been a player so long

    Maybe I reached my peak

    And now I''m on a plane

    Feeling so ashamed

    I didn''t catch her name

    So I call her Miss Everything

    [Hook]


    [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]

    Yah, you know my story

    I seen a lot of hoes

    A lot of gold diggers

    Luda call them pros

    I don''t call them back

    And thats just how it goes

    Most people call me Snoopy

    Or S-N-double-O

    But none of that really matters

    When I was in New York

    I had a show at The Garden

    You know, poppin'' corks

    That''s when I seen her

    From a distance

    She smiled and froze

    Now everything I learned in the game

    Told me she chose

    And I don''t miss a beat

    This time I gotta speak

    She looked magnificent

    Like something to eat

    Hey co, I can''t let her go

    I made my way through the crowd

    Let''s get out of here

    Head to Filipe Childs

    Lotta stars in place

    Doggy set the mood

    I''m like "I like your style"

    She''s like "I like yours too"

    Before I hit this plane

    I gotta know your name

    She smiled as if she came

    Call me Miss Everything

    [Verse 1: RBX]

    Flossy bitches in leathers

    Smellin'' like Prada, shakin'' their tailfeathers

    I hit the event with the hydro glow

    Never party pooper, super rhyme pro

    I can feel hatred when I step through the door

    Why you talkin'' bout me? You best watch your ho''

    ''Cause she is watchin'' me, I''m watchin'' her watch me

    She clockin'' the Versace, eyes locked to the crotchy

    I move to her, pimpin'', step it up a notchy

    The ''Zine play vivid, like a fifty-inch Hitachi

    With a body like a bottle, is your name Jeannie?

    You need to be with me, why you chillin'' with that weenie?

    Fool get mad, like he gon'' throw a fit

    Nigga, don''t you know the Glock ready to spit?

    Lord have his mercy, get this, nitwit

    It''s nasty in the gutter, don''t make the Glock spit

    Understand how we do it, cashin'' in and gettin'' sucked up

    For real, we don''t play, takin'' breaks when we can

    [Interlude 1: Bishop Don Magic Juan]

    The biggest fast time is rhyme the size crime

    I spot four one of these at the same time

    Looking like Snoop Dogg back in eighty-nine

    Do I give a fuck, no I never have

    I just blow my weed and take a bubble bath

    I laugh at these niggas, I ain''t mad at you niggas

    Cause half of you niggas can''t even fuck with me

    I''m on it cause I''m so fucking city

    And every town that I roll through I leave my G prints

    LBC, now that''s what I represent, can ya feel it (Eastside)

    I''m hotter than a batch of fish grease in a skillet

    I wanna say what up to all the G''s, the killas, and the ballers, and the dealers

    That nigga with that blue coat on? (Yeah)

    Yeah, oh yeah, that''s that nigga

    Man, hand me my motherfucking Glock man, give me another clip

    ''Cause I''m gonna smoke this fool

    As I look up at the sky

    My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye

    My body temperature falls

    I''m shaking and they break in tryna save the Dogg

    Pumping on my chest and I''m screaming

    I stop breathing, damn, I see demons

    Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?

    I can''t die, my boo boo''s ''bout to have my baby

    I think it''s too late for praying, hold up

    A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying

    Bring your lifestyle to me, I''ll make it better

    How long will I live? Eternal life and forever

    And will I be the G that I was?

    I''ll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of

    So relax your soul, let me take control

    Close your eyes, my son, my eyes are closed

    Murder

    Murder was the case that they gave me

    Murder

    Murder was the case that they gave me

    [Verse 2]

    I''m fresh up out my coma

    I got my Mama and my Daddy and my homies in my corner

    It''s gonna take a miracle they say

    For me to walk again and talk again, but anyway

    I get fronted some ki''s to get back on my feet

    And everything that nigga said came to reality

    Living like a baller loc

    Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke

    I bought my Mama a Benz and bought my boo boo a Jag

    And now I''m rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad

    Just remember who changed your mind

    ''Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine

    Indeed, agreed, proceed to smoke weed

    Never have a want, never have a need

    They say I''m greedy but I still want more

    ''Cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really though (Check it out)

    [Bridge]

    Now I lay me down to sleep

    I pray the Lord, my soul to keep

    If I should die before I wake

    I pray the Lord, my soul to take


    [Verse 3]

    No more indo, gin and juice

    I''m on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose

    Shackled from head to toe

    Twenty-five with an izzel, with nowhere to gizzo, I know

    Them niggas from the other side recognize my face

    ''Cause it''s the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C

    Mad dogging niggas ''cause I don''t care

    Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair

    Niggas stare as I enter the center

    They send me to a level three yard, that''s where I stay

    Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor

    Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war

    Pops off, ''cause you can''t tell what''s next

    My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck

    And he probably won''t make it to see twenty-two

    I put that on my Mama, I''ma ride for you, Baby Boo

    Be real, watch ya back

    Cuz if you don''t these niggas gone getcha black


    [Snoop Dogg]

    Now you wonder why I put so much pressure on my brothers

    But niggas is niggas, and I can''t put it no other -

    Way, just play and say what you wanna say

    Niggas is the same all throughout the USA

    I been around the world, and I came on back home

    And niggas is the same, they always try to get ya boy

    They like dogs, squabblin, tryin to get yours

    But if you ain''t gone open it, they knock down the doors

    They gone take what they get, gonna get what they take

    And if you gone be fake, check that shit from the gate

    If you afraid of the dark, then stay out the alley

    They got blacks being blacks way out in the valley

    I used to be afraid, like to be shook up

    Cuz niggas like you always leave the game hooked up

    Tryna get yours, but you gone get it too fast

    Cuz I''mma tell ya, watch them niggas

    Cuz them black ass niggas on the move in the mash boy

    And niggas don''t care cuz they out for cash and they know

    If they catch you slippin, they gettin you and gettin away

    Its part of the pay, its part of the day, they do it they way

    And if you black it goes on like ev-er-y-day

    I don''t know black on black, black for black

    But blacks take off on blacks

    Blacks need to realize and wake up

    And see we all one color, all one game

    You my sister, you my brother

    So you my daddy, or you my mother

    I don''t know but I know we all realated

    And if we stay down there''s no way that they can fade it

    But that''s just a game peice from me to y''all

    But if black on black gone continue to brawl

    Then black gone fall, then black knah

    Y''all better wake up and check out the black Dogg

    [Male singer]

    So Snoop Dogg speak the real

    It don''t even make a difference if it got matching sho''real


    [Snoop Dogg]

    Uh, its like that

    Then your black, they out for ya stack

    And its a fact, when your black, ya can''t come back

    Cuz if ya go to the hood, they watchin you

    They will lurk in you, they gonna get you

    Cuz your not payin attention, you led a nigga too much

    But that nigga straight snitchin

    Because I want you to sit your kids down, and tell them this story


    [Verse 1: James Wright]

    Back when I was a little boy, you see

    My life wasn''t always perfect (perfect)

    I remember my grandma praying

    And she said one day it''ll be worth it (worth it)

    She said, "Sit yourself down and listen to me

    And let me tell you a little story

    This story won''t take to long

    But I''ma tell you about his glory,"

    She said

    My God!

    Is the man that died for me

    My God!

    Said he gave me victory

    My God!

    Will supply your every need

    Until he saved a wretch like me

    Now I''m here to tell the story

    So that that you will be set free!


    [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]

    Well once upon a time in the Church of God

    There was sinners and saints

    Wills and won''ts

    The haves to the have-nots

    Will be sittin'' up front

    Gettin'' the sermon up close

    [?] the reverend [?] the offerings

    We live in a benevolent lifetime, so stay right

    I''m preachin'' ''em teachin'' ''em givin'' em more than a look

    My granny raised me right about the Good Book

  Neva Have 2 Worry: '[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    1992, "Deep Cover" hit the world and fell in love with Snoop

    "Doggystyle" came out, it''s like I dropped a bomb

    One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time

    I was young gettin'' money, livin'' wild and free

    Got on and I brought the whole Pound with me

    Didn''t matter who''s around, I kept it way too G

    Niggas knew it was Eastside L.B.C

    Gangsta shit, that''s what a motherfuckin'' gangsta get

    The one up above didn''t like my pace

    I was movin'' too fast and I caught that case

    I fought that case, wonder where the West would be if I''da lost that case

    I slow mine down, swimmin'' with the sharks and I almost drowned


    [Hook: Uncle Chucc]

    I done made some mistakes along the way

    To become the G I am today

    Who had ever thought I''d make this far?

    Out the hood to be a big star

    And I ain''t goin'' nowhere

    Homie I ain''t never comin'' down

    I''m too high in the clouds

    To ever have to worry ''bout that


    [Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

    I''m finally out

    And the critics hated on me cause I went to the South

    Said I wasn''t gon'' shine, had me left for dead

    Switched sides, now my old boss want me dead

    Dropped the first of the three and you said it was weak

    "No Limit Top Dogg", the return of the beast

    So from that point on I know what to do

    Don''t worry ''bout them just do what you do

    "Last Meal" was the one that took me off the leash

    That''s the last time a nigga gon'' eat off of me

    Stack plaque after plaque, gain millions sold

    I''m the Bo$$ of this bitch and I ain''t never went Gold, nigga

    Motherfucker I''m a G, but first I''m a man

    Freedom of Speech, bitch is a word you can''t ban

    So they blamin'' me, sayin'' this my talk

    Came back for Him, the body was gone

    All that was left was the stone

    The Sword it was on

    Two feet, on two wings

    Blood and meat from the bone

    A risen kingdom, but no mobile phones

    Just faithful messengers

    Everyday is being used in mysterious ways

    And everything is a cost with some pain

    Some lonely days, Jehovah knows

    High on the throne, Christ to the right

    This pen can''t write the sights of my home

    In spite of miracles, doubt abounds

    Octo-, with tentacles

    I can''t make it without the faith to know

    It''s only Christ that rights the fights of unknown

    [*slows down*]

    I can''t make it without the faith to know

    It''s only Christ that rights the fights of unknown


    I can''t make it without the faith to know

    It''s only Christ that rights the fights of unknown'

    And niggas throughout this hemisphere, far and near

    Prepare, catch me chillin like the winter

    Up against the number one contender, as I enter

    Cause I gets heated like friction

    Telepathic addiction, to this homicidal recital

    Dangerous and vital to all my rivals

    Suicidal, brainwaves conveys

    To the average motherf**ker''s minds these days

    Tonight''s the night for me to rip microphones

    Into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis

    Gets me into verbally vindictive

    Violent vocabulary bobs to existance

    Catch me in the pitch black path

    I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental

    Till I hear an instrumental

    And detrimental verbals get to spittin

    The highest in intellect, try connectin with the written

    Now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen

    To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war

    Dips like a low-low, with my verbal fo''-fo''

    Fo sho'', I takes it to you from the do''

    I came from the bottom of the barrel, to everyday new apparel

    From a shoe string budget to more jewelry than a pharaoh

    Up out a place called Vallejo, house smaller than a hut

    First city in California to go bankrupt

    Came a long way, let the truth be told

    Penitentiary chances sweating over the stove

    Seen them come and go, I''m the last of my crop

    Don''t compare me to nobody unless you''re talking bout Pac

    Just trying to survive and stay alive, so many of my people done died

    Nowadays, you''re an O.G. if you live to be 25

    My partner in there with his grand-daddy doing 25

    Lifting water bags, doing burpees exercise

    I hand pick my friends cause people ain''t trustable

    Feelings like broads, their motives is questionable

    Suckers sneak diss me and call me up on the phone

    They say, "40 Water, I just wanna be on"

    Yeah, what ima do right here is take my time

    And dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace

    And my niggas behind the wall

    See you when I get there, you know what Im saying? (really doe)

    So drip with me as I go down memory lane

    Boy it''s a loony where the grass is greener

    (1-8-7 ain''t shit but a misdemeanor)

    Ive seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up

    Some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed

    But it''s a east side thang, a hoo ride thang

    (cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang)

    I bring you the motherfucking .38

    (just get the mc and the homie nate)

    So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide

    As I take you on a trip nigga ride (east side)

    Nate (daz):

    Do you remember back on the east side?

    Where all us niggas used to love to ride

    We didn''t care what we did

    Time was nothing to us we were just kids

    Times are different now, but you still get stuck

    Im not a kid no more, I just don''t give a fuck

    So if you''re thinking about coming and stepping to me

    Keep this in mind: Im a motherfucking o.g

    Snoop:

    Lets speed the clock up and pass some time

    June 17th, 1979

    That''s my first time being arrested

    I know I did the crime, but I ain''t going to confess to this shit

    I learned than from the gs

    A g is an overseer, the overseer sees

    More than you do cause he gets experienced

    And besides Im just a juvenile delinquent

    So I was gone, and Im on my way home

    My mommas going to get me, and I flee with (? ? ? )

    She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb

    We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones

    She telling me that I didn''t need to do what I done

    She said: "playing football should be your only fun son"

    Im like "allright" so we enter the house

    Come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth

    I couldn''t do nothing but cry like a bitch

    I looked at my momma and said: "damn, why you snitch? "

    They put me on punishment but that didn''t work

    Now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a t-shirt

    And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides

    I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time

    Nate:

    My homie told me one day he had a jack move

    He said: "come on nate dogg, it''ll be smooth"

    I agreed and said "come on, lets go and jack them fools"

    Next day we were draped in the county blues

    I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years)

    Saying to myself "ill never fuck with that nigga again"

    Fore Im locked down I learned to be

    What I am now and that''s a motherfucking o.g

    Original gangsta

    Daz:

    I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials

    Never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile

    Youd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an o.g.,

    Beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some hillfigers

    The man behind the trigger, committing robberies

    With the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me

    Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me

    Because we ain''t letting the bullshit slide no more

    Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door

    To let you know we can''t take no more

    Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends

    And let you pay the cost for my homies life, it''s lost

    Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair

    And ask myself: "who the fuck should I really fear? "

    I ran around with the best killers

    Thug criminals and drug dealers

    Blasting niggas if they come near us

    (? ? ? ) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could

    Knock on wood for good luck

    Serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now youve been struck

  "On TDE: \u201CThey\u2019re Not Death Row\u201D": 'No, they''re not the new Death
    Row

    Because TDE did it completely different than Death Row did it. Death Row did it
    with a gangster approach. We...we were smashin on niggas, we was fuckin people
    up. We was..determined to be the hardest, meanest, baddest, coldest, roughest
    toughest in the game. That was our mission. Uhh..TDE. Rappers. They''re peaceful,
    they love, they get down. They got rappers from everywhere and they represent
    hip-hop and they don''t represent negativity and violence. And tryin to mash and
    disrespect it. So it''s like, that how Death row came.. We came out disrespectin''
    Eazy E and anyone who had a problem with Dr. Dre.

    That was our first get down. It was "fuck dem niggas up first". That''s not TDE
    mentality. Their mentality is cool with everybody. Kendrick Lamar flipped out
    on everybody. That''s that Death Row influence, that may have cause him to backslide
    and feel a certain way. Which I support fully and his thoughts in what he said...Cause
    I''m from the West Coast, fuck errbody who got a problem with it.

    But I don''t feel like TDE and Death Row are the same thing in any way. I feel
    like Death Row paved the way for TDE...To do it in their own way... So they can
    stay around 20 years from now.

    You gotta go hard if you get a chance to hit that

    If you hit it then you gotta hit it harder

    Built a massive team that''s passion themed

    Do it for the love, on top there''s the cream

    I do it ''til I did that, get enough

    Run it up, rake enough, make enough to give back

    Ohh baby, in the world of paper, paper


    [Snoop Dogg]

    Thinkin of a master plan

    Cause ain''t nuttin but sweat inside my hand

    So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent

    So I dig deeper, but still comin up with lint

    So I, start my mission, leave my residence

    Thinkin how can I get some dead presidents

    I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid

    So I think of all the devious things I did

    I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain''t nuttin funny

    Stop smilin, cause still don''t nuttin move but the money

    Cause now I''ve learned to earn cause I''m righteous

    I feel great, so maybe I might just

    Search fo'' a 9 to 5, if I strive

    Then maybe I''ll stay alive

    So I walk up the street, whistlin this

    Feelin out of place cause man do I miss

    A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of

    Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of

    Chicken wings, cause that''s my favorite thang

    But without no money man that shit''s a dream

    Cause I don''t like to dream about gettin paid

    So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I''ve made

    Soon as I bust ''em see if I got pull

    I gank suckers like you for thick gold chains

    (He don''t deserve it) Hell nah

    So take it off your neck

    ''Cause Goddamn, you ain''t comin'' correct

    What''s this, a sucker duck holdin'' a mic?

    And like Keith Sweat said, somethin'' just ain''t right

    Seems nowadays everybody wanna be a rapper

    Down wit'' crews

    But they ain''t never paid dues

    Suckers perpetratin'', playin'' hardcore

    Punks, I bet you worked at a flower store

    You know what eats me up the most?

    Is when a sucker just started and thinks he''s high post

    You ain''t pay a nann due in your life

    Talkin'' ''bout a new style, you know who you sound like?

    KRS, Chuck D, Kool Moe, as one

    Yellin'' on the mic like ya name was Run

    You''se a peon, went and bought a pair of Lee''s

    Now all of a sudden you supposed to be an MC?

    Yo, that''s wack, it just ain''t right

    You only stood on one stage in your whole damn life

    Now you want respect, hey yo, you''se a fool

    Everybody wanna rap, but they ain''t paid dues

    You might also likeI can still remember way, way back in the days

    The times me and Aladdin dreamed of gettin'' paid

    Standin'' outside just to pull in the jacks

    To earn a little money to drop a dope track

    Back in the days I drove a raggedy Dodge

    Couldn''t afford a studio, so we used a garage

    Aladdin used to grab a gang of disco breaks

    One turntable and a broken 808

    My little brother Tunes and Frank, they hung around all night

    To make sure that the demo was tight

    Didn''t have an enigneer, if you know what I mean

    Aladdin did it all at the age of 16

    Gifted, uplifted, straight gangsta Mack

    Suckers had me playin'' the back


    But thanks to Ice-T I got my foot in the door

    Now I''ma rock the mutha-(uh) till it ain''t no more

    We paid dues


    I knew a brother who used to dress just like a faggot

    Real tight jeans, some boots and leather jackets

    Homie as hell, he never came outside

    ''Cause everytime I came around, he used to run and hide

    Spoiled like a brat, had everything he wanted

    And when he walked, he switched like a woman

    Rode a pink bike, man, the sucker was soft

    Had to be in before the street lights came on

    Yo, just the other day I turned my radio on

    The Mack Attack kicked on a brand new song

    I didn''t know what it was, I never heard it before

    But the record was smooth and hardcore

    I said to myself, "Hey yo, I gotta see this group."

    So I called up Aladdin and the rest of the crew

    Grabbed the nine wit'' the hollow point tip

    Stepped in the party with a gangster limp

    Took a look at the stage, and yo, whaddya know?

    The same old faggot from a long time ago

    From real tight jeans and the go-go boots

    He went to Pendeltons and a khaki suit

    Now tell me, ain''t this a blip?

    Somebody need to slap the perpetrator in the lip

    Yesterday he was a mamma''s boy, now he''s rappin?

    Foolin'' the crowd because he got you all clappin''

    And tappin'', an example of what I''m tryin'' to prove

    A sucker like this who ain''t never paid dues

    So to those who wanna rap, I''m pertainin'' to you

    Before you pick up a mic, you gotta pay dues, word

    Let the story be told

    That''s the way it is

    You got to pay yo'' dues


    Low Profile definitely in the buildin'', ya dig?

  "Pimp Slapp\u2019d": '[DJ E-Z Dick]

    W-Balls, it''s your main man DJ E-Z Dick

    About to unleash another one of those platnum plus hits

    And the word is on the streets, and the word is the streets

    We gon go to a live remote, licking wit my main man Mr Doggy Dogg


    [Snoop Dogg]

    A day in the life, of a Rollin'' 20 Crip

    I''m just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick

    Now just because I sip Moet, they say that I''m hopeless

    But I don''t give a fuck, so blame it on the loc''ness

    Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip

    Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don''t even trip

    I bust a funky composition that''s as smooth as a prism

    So check it while I kick off in this funky-ass rhythm

    It''s six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck

    And it''s some homies talking about I disrespected they set

    Aww nah, Dogg ain''t diss y''all

    I got a couple relatives up off of Crenshaw

    This is about me and Simon, not me and y''all

    I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs

    Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Real, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face

    And the homie Heron rest in peace

    Big Jay from Campanella Park

    He used to blaze with his nephew after dark

    On and on, rocking big Neckbone

    Mausberg I had to put you on my song

    It''s so real, I had to show some love

    Now back to this scrub, it ain''t about Crip or Blood

    It''s about you bein'' jealous of what I does

    Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast

    In the paint playin'' post - I back you down

    Like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy

    And skirt up Wilshire Boulevard

    I''m not Xzibit, you can''t pull my ho card,,,

    I fucked all your groupies

    When you was doing time in Camp Snoopy

    With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches

    And you was payin'' niggas off with all my riches,,,

    You so hardco'', why you ain''t go to level fo''?

    Oh I know (bitch!)

    But I walk the mainline every time I go down

    You can check my G Files I do it L.B.C. style

    I got the word on you Simon

    You need to just start rhymin''

    Cause you the biggest star on your label

    And them other niggas just crumbs off my table

    You''re not able, to compete with the heat that I drop

    And I still ain''t been paid, for "1-8-7 on a cop"

    I started yo'' shit and I will end yo'' shit

    If you keep talkin shit on Crip!

    [Snoop Dogg]

    If I shoot you, I''ll be brainless, and you''ll be famous

    And I''ll be spending money out the anus

    Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level

    Man you worse than them devils

    Alotta niggas should''ve said it, fuck em

    But I''ma say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em

    This nigga''s a bitch like his wife

    Suge Knight''s a bitch, and that''s on my life

    And I''ma let the whole world see

    Cause you fucked up the industry, and that''s on me

    We can go head up, nigga, set it up

    Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up

    Your rappers and artists, tell ''em, shut it up

    ''Cause I''ll fuck every last one of ''em up, especially Kurupt (shhhhhhh)

    See that''s my lil homeboy, so he knows what''s up (what''s up),

    He better keep it Crippin'', and slip his clip in

    Cause these niggas trippin'', this is official business

    Do the same way, leave no witnesses

    This is that unexpected, misdirected, sprayed, covered and protected

    Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it

    It''s all to the good again

    You can catch Snoopy D.O. double in the hood again (Eastside)

    Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit

    To make the whole world feel it (feel it)

    So put the bacon in the skillet (hahaha), and try to peel it

    Cause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga

    [Snoop Dogg]

    Baby girl you so so-phisticated

    Finance related, you graduated

    To the next level in the game, wearin my name

    Bad little brickhouse, go and do that thang


    [Eve]

    Yo - niggas surprised when they open they eyes

    Thick in the thighs wasn''t part of they plan

    Not just his bitch, I''m like his main man

    Act shifty - your resistance gone swiftly

    Bitches mad at a nigga, askin why he kissed me

    Stop whinin, just to cry and get the mackin daddy

    I don''t like it when the angry chick is actin crabby

    That''s why he bagged me

    Ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy

    No stressin over chicks - problem? Bet I solve it fastly

    We gangbang on these niggas like we ''posed to do

    And I''ll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you

    We posted Boo - you, my, one and only

    Quick to dump before the homies

    Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?

    You filled him up with slugs, that''s what I call love

    All that pushin and shovin, kissin and huggin

    Thuggin, dig it, dug-in

    I''m lovin every minute of it Boo

    The way you stay true, and always kept your cool

    You kept the heater right by your thigh

    And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride

    You didn''t run out, when I pulled the gun out

    That''s what I''m talkin bout, no doubt

    Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin, to the realest y''know

    D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy


    [Eve]

    Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga''s all I need

    Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees

    Don''t violate, see my man, he don''t like no scrapes

    And if I heard you was frontin I hop on the case

    Wild one? Maybe, but I''mma protect my baby

    Test me fool and by the end you gon'' think I''m crazy

    That''s how I do for my Dogg, keep my litter strong

    Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song

    [Verse 1: Dat Nigga Daz]

    It''s 12:30 a.m., Christmas Eve

    I''m out with the gangstas and thieves

    Celebratin'', postin'' up with eggnog head up-up in my cup

    Put Rudolph in motion, sleigh all bang-bangin'' and coastin''

    Down the block, but be careful for the hawk because it''s posted

    Some stay to this day that Christmas ain''t nothing but another day

    But, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day

    Tell me, tell me, where do the homeless and bums got to sleep? (Nowhere)

    Where do hungry and the needy-greedies got to eat? (But who cares?)

    Life is so crucial and cold, as for, for the children

    In this world they hopes and dreams can''t unfold

    The young and old churches, the spiritual dreams, seasonal things

    Heard throughout the ghetto, reaches gangstas and dope fiends, huh

    ''Cause those who ain''t able get it now can finally get it

    ''Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood, now we ballin''

    Livin'' to a new year of better thangs

    Celebrate it with some Champagne, haha, check it (Yeah)

    Now on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me

    A sack of the Krazy Glue and told me to smoke it up slowly

    Now on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me

    A fifth of Henn-dawg and told me to take my mind off that weed

    Now by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me

    A whole lot of everything, and it wasn''t nothin'' but game to me


    [Verse 2: Bad Azz]

    Back then, you woke up to the sound of "I Saw Mama Kissing Santa"

    Made you reminisce on the old fashion Christmas days

    Gifts, Mr. Fat Man jolly with joy

    Down ya chimney with toys for lil'' girls and boys

    Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in

    And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin'' down my hall

    Run to the window, put my eyes to the sky

    To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy

    I sigh, ain''t no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine

    My bike, that, and this plastic nine''ll do fine ''til next year come

    I try to see the same thing, they got us brainwashed dumb

    And when you find it ain''t no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot

    ''Cause it''s the time to get together and give all you got

    You got food, good moods, and what''s better than together with your people

    Well-wishers give a toast by the tree, it''s Merry Christmas

    Santa Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin''

    Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain

    Season''s greetings, all the proceedings

    Are brought to you by the church house where we''ll be eatin''

    Chestnuts roastin'' on a open fire

    Singin'' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle?

    I didn''t pout and I ain''t even shouted

    I even stayed in the house when the homies tried to sneak me out

    And all I want for Christmas is my six-four Chevrolet

    And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly

    Ain''t that somethin''? (Uh-huh) Nah, ain''t that nothin''

    How it''s Christmas time and my rhyme''s steady bumpin''

    Everybody happy (Happy), hair still nappy

    Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy

    Catch me giving out turkeys at the church house

    Don''t try to work me, just stand in line and everything gon'' be fine

    Holla at ya folks, boy, it''s goin'' down

    Ain''t no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound

    And we passin'' out gifts, blazin'' up spliffs

    Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer

    Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin'' baked

    To be ate after everything gone off your plate

    But wait, not tonight it''s straight beans and rice

    On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?

    I wonder what the morn bringin'' so it''s hard to doze off

    Three ''o clock in my socks I crack the door soft

    Hopin'' when I open the door I''ll see Santa

    Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana?

    Messin'' with the boxes that''s up under the tree

    Look like Santa Claus done crossed into a woman to me

    Now I''m comin'' to see the whole picture gettin'' clearer

    How we have less as X-Mas get nearer

    Mirror, mirror, please, it''s seemed I''ve been deceived

    And thank you, Saint Trick, for the gifts I received

    So I creep back, and act like I ain''t even peeped it

    When I peeped this little freak out

    And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips

    You so right I''m gon'' beat

    So I approached the chick with the real pretty face

    Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist

    I whispered in her ear, "Lil'' mama, what you drink?

    I know that you''re a freak but you know that I ain''t gon'' say shh"

    G''s don''t fall in love, that''s what they told me, cuz

    Now if it''s true or not, if it''s you or not

    We stayed up for a few days, we layed up for a few days

    It became a workout, then we started doing two things

    You started actin'' weird on it, on the real, homie

    And then she slipped away and disappeared on me

    And told a lie at the same time

    And had my heart in her hand, and I ain''t even lying

    [Verse 3: Devin The Dude]

    Yeah, Snoop, that kinda remind me

    Of back in the day, when my niggas, they tried to find me

    But I be between them titties and them thighs ''til dust

    Talkin'' bout five, six times, shit, I still bust

    That''s how fine she was, I laid it all down because

    Thought we was in love, we had more than peach fuzz down there

    But still young, I hung with my niggas

    She roll by herself, you know, one deep chick

    I didn''t think that she would sneak out late night to fuck

    ''Cause she like my snake, my snake likin'' her

    I bought her puss, I bought her shoes, bought her bongs

    Our homeboy showed me his phone, bitch had the same drawers on

    I''m like, "Oh, no, she''s a liar, she''s a cheater"

    Wanted to meet her at the crib so I can fight her with my penis

    Found out that her ex-friends wanted to kick her ass

    ''Cause she sucked the dick of every man that they''ve had


    [Chorus: Devin the Dude]

    Yeah, she''s a liar, she''s a cheater

    And a ho, I didn''t need her

    But I really couldn''t leave her

    I think I fell in love with her (I fucked around and fell in love)

    Yeah, she''s a liar, she''s a cheater

    And a ho, I didn''t need her

    But I really couldn''t leave her

    I think I fell in love with her (In love with her)'

    So I decided, to ride it

    Roses are red, and Violets are blue

    I''m buyin you gifts, draping you out, with gold

    I''m showin you love, you''s above any other hoe

    Tattoo wit my name on your tits

    For the weddin, the settin was set

    40 G''s for your ring, you''s a Queen sippin Moet

    I''m upset, and I don''t even want to have jip out

    But baby didn''t give it to me, ughh

    I was down at the alter, I seen Sister Salta

    Said "lady could you pray for me?" ughh

    I''m in a love affair, I can''t share, it ain''t fair

    Because my life is my wife, and that ain''t right

    Don''t wanna go home, I know I''m gonna get into a fight

    I called my sidepiece and tell her I''mma spend the night

    And if she out of town, baby we'' gon'' book a flight

    She got it laid out with incense and candlelights

    How could you rap over beats that whack?

    You ain''t reachin'' the crowd, you ain''t makin'' your fact

    You ain''t droppin'' lines that hit the top

    You can''t make the party go hip-hop

    And you can''t do your thing without using mine

    We get and steal, I see you''re on the grind

    But I''ma take my time to get my point across

    And if you get caught up in the rap shit then got lost

    And if you get tossed it''s on your own, it''s your own fault

    See I gots ta get mine, I don''t try no song

    I just move on, groove on, try to prove on

    Then I do mines to do mines and I''mma keep on, keep on, keep on

    To get''cha you in a... .smooth type of atmosphere

  Snoopafella: '[Verse 1]

    Once upon a time, in the L.B.C

    On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street

    There lived a young man, Cinderfella''s his name

    To make it interesting it''s me, peep game

    I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad

    And two step-brothers who treated me bad

    I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors

    And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores

    My brothers, they used to boast and brag:

    "We''ve got Fubu, and you''ve got rags!"

    And even worse than that, to make me feel low

    They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows

    Girls used to say, "Snoop, you''re so cute

    But you gets no rap with that to'' up khaki suit"

    Welllll, one day, up the Avenue

    There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew

    He said ah, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!

    The princess is having a royal ball

    If you can rap, also dress fresh

    You might win a date with the sweet princess"

    Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash

    I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad

    I said, "Step-dad, may I?"

    And before I could finish, "Hell no!", he replied (Cinderfella!)

    My brothers were goin, they were gettin down

    Even Pops was goin for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!)

    They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted

    "We can and you can''t," is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah)

    They all stood there, laughin in my face

    And as they walked out they said, "Clean up this place!"

    (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

    And I''m the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

    (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

    And I''m the rapper Doggy Dogg you love


    [Verse 2]

    Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss

    And I''d get them back if I had one wish

    Before I could make my thought a phrase

    There appeared a man from a puff of haze

    He said, "What''s up, Dogg? My name is Herb

    I''m your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!

    Now I''ve came here with the main purpose

    Of granting you your fondest wish"

    I said, "Herb, my man, just make me fresh

    And I''m sure that I can handle, all the rest"

    With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot

    And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit

    On my feet was some white tube socks

    And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock

    I showed him my sack, and don''t you know

    With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe

    Once again his hands began to flow

    Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo'' (damn!)

    He checked me over, passed me the keys

    And said, "One more thing before you leave...

    You must return before the stroke of twelve

    Or you''ll turn back into your old self"

    [Chorus]

    (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

    And I''m the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

    (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

    And I''m the rapper Doggy Dogg you love


    [Verse 3]

    I jumped in the low-low and went on my way

    I got to the party ''bout ten, I''d say

    It was after eleven when I rocked the mic

    And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well alright!)

    The princess was starin, while holdin a drank

    Reflected from her eyes was gold tank

    She waved her hands like, "Hello! Hi!"

    Then gave another gesture like, "Come here, guy!"

    I left the stage, girls came in flocks

    The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks

    I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock

    Gong! First bell before twelve o''clock

    No time to waste, I broke out in haste

    The princess followed in a futile chase

    A quick steady pace is what I kept

    Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps

    For the six-fo'' I continued my stride

    About this time I heard gong five

    I was down the block when I heard gong eight

    And the princess screamed out, "Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"

    [Chorus]

    (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

    And I''m the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

    (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

    And I''m the rapper Doggy Dogg you love


    [Verse 4]

    I was almost home when my luck ran out

    And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout

    My fresh low-low, also went too

    And there was no denyin that my night was through

    The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported

    Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded

    Made it to my pad, no time at all

    Went to my room, or better yet the far wall

    Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased

    Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z''s

    Early the next mornin, when I awoke

    I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat

    Slid into the front, my family stared at me

    Sayin, "Wasn''t that you? Nah, it couldn''t be"

    They kept askin me if I did my chores

    My butt was saved by a knock at the door

    "Who is it?", that''s what my brothers barked

    "The princess," this sweet voice remarked

    She said she was lookin for a certain man

    Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand

    The family ran around with their heads in the air

    Bringin her shoes from everywhere

    She just shook her head, a nod of relief

    And said, "No, that''s not the one that I''m lookin'' for, Chief"

    I ran in the room and got my shoe

    And said, "Is this the one you''re referring to?"

    Well she said, "Yes, and you''re so cute

    But where''s your doe-doe and slick silk suit?"

    I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light

    And I was wearin shit, from just last night

    Looked out the window, saw the six-fo''

    Yelled to my family, "I''ve GOT to go!"

    We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I

    And in back of me, I heard my family cry...


    [Chorus]

    (Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)

    And I''m the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

    And I''m the rapper Doggy Dogg you love

    It''s your uncle Snoop Dogg

    Let me show you how we keep the trap jumpin'' on the West Side

    The best side


    [Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    McDonald''s all American

    There''s really no comparing it

    I play some D and pop a three and fly up in the air again

    First-round draft pick came in with this rap shit

    Get a lot of moolah to keep you a bad bitch

    Those were the rules, I aimed for the full pie

    Took a slice and now I''m popping at the bull''s eye

    I''m equivalent to excellence

    With my weaponry, I''m stepping while I''m rapping it

    Now could I should I would I do things your way

    And end up dead or in jail? My nigga no way

    It''s like some good hot head with no foreplay

    I won''t be caught so I cut you like I''m OJ

    Kingpin Nietzche

    Designer Flow hand me the ball young dawg I need a heat check

    Reset, he wet

    Dikembe Mutombo, that we shit

    Nowadays nigga killing over nothing

    I been in my own lane since I was a youngin''

    Whole family had a bag, I''m the plug''s cousin

    But I found my own plug, the ain''t front me nothin

    But my nigga Black did give me that Gucci belt (black)

    This where I put my heat I never leave it on the shelf (strapped)

    My heart froze I don''t ever leave it on my sleeves (nah)

    I got hoes I ain''t never met a bitch I need

    So when she tell me that she leaving i''m a let her leave

    My aroma in her room ain''t gon'' let her breathe

    Got it smelling like some money and a couple g''s

    It''s on record I could smash who I want

    Put this on record, put this on record

    In the trap I do my best to help em out

    And all some niggas ever did was fuck up the count

    And all some niggas ever did was run they fucking mouth

    Had to keep it moving had to keep my head up

    Had to re-up and recoup to get my bread up

    Had to take a nigga boo and put her legs up

    Her nigga probably do the same with my main thing

    Still ride with the flag for the gang gang

    I''m a real trap nigga, I don''t gang bang

    I done been across the map with the propane

    They''ll point a nigga out get your old man

    Put the noodle in her mouth like the low mein

    Kill a nigga with a strap like a gay bitch

    Made a band in a minute off 8 sips

    Tried to walk away from trapping but I can''t quit

    And all my Doggs are invited so go on and light it

    Cause it''s the first time in a longtime and I just might

    Reminisce about the Fresh Fest back in ''85

    When the Dubs and Insaniacs used to Hoo Ride

    It was easy just to serve on the curb that''s how I do

    Ain''t no slippin, dippin, now I''m sipping on my brew

    Staying true cause now I''m supposed to

    Grab my little friend, then my deuce deuce

  Story to tell: '[Intro]

    You''re back now at the jack-off hour

    This is DJ Eaazy Dick

    On W-Balls

    Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg

    And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys

    A big bow wow wow

    Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight

    This is DJ Eazy Dick

    On the station that slaps you across your fat ass

    With a fat dick


    [Verse 1: Nate Dogg]

    When I met you last night, baby

    Before you opened up your gap

    I had respect for you lady

    But now I take it all back

    Cause you gave me all your pussy

    And you even licked my balls

    Leave your number on the cabinet

    And I promise baby, I''ll give you a call

    Next time I''m feeling kinda horny

    You can come on over

    And I''ll break you off

    And if you can''t fuck that day baby

    Just lay back and open your mouth

    Cause I have never met a girl

    That I love in the whole wide world

    You might also like[Verse 2: Kurupt]

    Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I''d always be broke

    I''d never have no motherfucking endo to smoke

    I gets loc''ed and loony

    Bitch you can''t do me

    Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie

    I have no love for hoes

    That''s something that I learned in tha Pound

    So how the fuck am I supposed

    To pay this ho just to lay this ho

    I know the pussy''s mine

    I''mma fuck a couple more times

    And then I''m through with it

    There''s nothing else to do with it

    Pass it to the homie, now you hit it

    Cause she ain''t nothing but a bitch to me

    And y''all know that bitches ain''t shit to me

    I gives a fuck

    Why don''t y''all pay attention

    Approach her with a different proposition

    I''m Kurupt ho

    You''ll never be my only one, trick ass bitch


    [Hook]

    It ain''t no fun if the homies can''t have none

    [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]

    Guess who back in the motherfucking house

    With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth

    Hoes recognize, niggas do too

    Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo

    What you gon do

    You really don''t know

    So I''d advise you not to trust that ho

    Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch

    Knowing damn well I''m too caught up with my grip

    Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger

    How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop

    Doggy, I''m all the above

    I''m too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes

    But see it ain''t no fun

    If my homies can''t get a taste of it

    Cause you know I don''t love em


    [Verse 4: Warren G]

    Hey now you know

    Inhale, exhale with my flow

    One for the money, two for the bitches

    Three to get ready and four to hit the switches

    In my Chevy, ''64 -- red to be exact

    With bitches on my side and bitches on my back

    So back up, bitch, because I''m struggling

    So get on your knees and then start juggling

    These motherfucking nuts in your mouth

    It''s me, Warren G the nigga with the clout'

    Polarizin'', prophesizin'', I''m what put us on the map

    At Poly bustin'' down them P-O-U-N-D''s into them sacks

    Poundin'' pavement with the pushers, pocket rocket for the pussies

    Player tried to play me cold, I left him bleedin'' in the bushes

    I''m like a pigeon with precision, Snoopy shittin'' from the top

    Piggly Wigglys on patrol, tryna pop us at the park

    Partner, please, we just posted up, we plottin'' on some paper, man

    Just popped a Pontiac and peach is probably what I''ll paint the thang

    Papered up, I can''t complain

    Still, I play the game, but it won''t ease the pain

    And ya don''t stop it''s Snoop Dogg on the microphone

    Let me peep things out

    Took a lookin'' around

    And what should I talk about first on the list

    Let me just kiss the microphone and bless it like that

    Because the people love to hear me

    And they love to hear me rap

    Because once I''m on the microphone I start to flow

    I get in nigga''s shit and the people say hooo

    Doggy Dogg''s in the place

    While I rock the microphone laced and [?]

    Put your hands on the turntables and scratch

    While I find a funky to attach then match

    As I play together, then I switch it

    Then I look in the crowd and I see seven bitches

    Lookin'' at me hollerin'' out Snoopy

    But from here on out I got no room for no groupies

    So I tell ''em to steppin'' then I find me a fly hoe

    Take her to my motel, then it''s time to go

    See my homie [?] chillin'' and a villian as he usually does

    He says blaze up a bud

    Give him ten dollars then he pass me a sack

    Doggy Dogg why don''tcha kick ya funky ass raps

    So I took the microphone and kicked a couple of tunes

    Glaze about to scratch and then the bit boom

    The boom went boom then it broke on the floor

    Everyone said Dogg give us some more

    So I said hol'' up for a second

    Let me find my right beat so Glaze grab a record

    Then he started to scratch and put his hands on the turntable

    Showin'' he was able and stable from the cable

    From his neck got to swangin'' and hangin''

    Then he said Doggy Dogg I heard ya slangin''

    I said slangin'' rhymes, that''s the only dope that I slang

    And where ya from?

    Rollin'' 20 Crip gang

    Never slip or trip or dip

    When I gets fucked up it''s gin that I sip

    Smokin'' on the bomb-ass indo ya know

    Chillin'' wit'' my homie [?] at the show

    Sittin'' in the front row, never in the back

    Gettin'' big respect cause we both know how to rap

    And when he''s not to rappin'' he''s doin'' all the mackin''

    When he''s got the nine you can say the nigga''s packin''

    When ya say he''s out there clockin'', he''s jackin''

    And it''s up to me Doggy Dogg, I do the rappin''

    Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke

    I toke everyday, I loc everyday

    With the P-O-U-N-D and my nigga, Dr. Dre

    Lay back in the cut like I told your ass

    Give me the microphone and let me hit you with a blast

    And bitches who fuck him give me the ass

    ''Cause they know about the shit that we be goin'' through

    And they know about the shit that I be puttin'' up

    I must confess that in the Chi'' you''re so blessed

    Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex

    This ain''t a test, you fucking with a cold mess

    Meet me in Chicago, let me hip you to this real west

    It''s real strong, real fat and real long

    Doggies in the building, holdin'' something they can feel up on

    And once they get it something they can build up on

    Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it''s gone

    But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it''s

    I need just to bust with one

    Cause am full of fun

    Am on 2-1 street

    Cause thats where i chill at and live

    So watch me grab the microphone

    And come negative

    No need to come popping?

    Cause that ain''t the life i live

    I grab the mic and i begin to lay a

    A rhyme i wrote i quote is dope

    A scrub i scope am a dogg i could never be a loc

    Now watch me flow into another rhyme

    And as you listen to the lyrics you will say its about time

    For snoop the dogg to do his thing

    And put ya''ll all in the insane type of thing

    Thats what am talking about without a doubt

    Ya scream and dream and fiend ya know what I mean

    I comes correct on every tape i''m on

    My word is born you love to listen to my songs

    Me and my homie G Dub

    While i rock the mic

    He grabs the tables and scrubs

    Then the when the ladies love it

    Because when we make a tape

    Ya suckers be begging and bugging

    Love it, dub it, that''s what they wanna do

    So let me take the microphone and begin to do a funky style of rhyme with combination

    I''m coming correct with another illustration

    But as i flow into another mind? you listen

    Don''t interrupt cause my comprehension

    Level gets deeper by the second

    This a funky fresh song in other words a record

    That''s coming through your ears

    Thinking bout ''86 damn I was overdue

    Walking in the hood making mix tapes trying to walk up out the hood

    While I''m chucking at the hood nigga talk about the hood

    That I came from it raised me real Crip crazy

    What up, oops a daisy

    Demon or a heathen, scheming while I''m dreaming

    Screaming to get even, seeing is believing

    And don''t you forget that

    Get it to you get back hit that kick back

    Three flies one a way

    Reminisce about the things that my grandmama use to say

    Make it back to my ride

    Pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side

    My big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo

    Slid me away just to get me away

    I''m just a Long Beach nigga outside of my hood

    I''m banging riding but doing it good

    When I get locked down there ain''t hiding and wondering

    As soon as I hit the County I''m up in 48 hundred

    With the dealers the killers the realest

    The best from the west and the beast from the east

    Yeah I''m acting a fool

    I''m getting my degree from gladiator school

    I chose this life cause I knows this life

    Sell a little crack and my flows is tight

  Think About It: 'Yeah man...


    "You know it''s easy to talk about.. doin somethin

    But when it comes down to the action part, well most folks take a little light
    vacation"


    [Snoop Dogg]

    Mmmm.. I was just thinkin to myself man

    Y''know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me

    And I need to let my

    Peoples know how deep it is to me

    On some real talk like...


    It''s like lookin and poppin and seein whoppers and movers

    Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low

    Nobody''s guidance so I decide to sleep by the do''

    Open my mind try to slip inside my grandpa''s fo''

    Driftin off into another stage of life

    Nigga paid ya price and big homies made ya fight

    Niggas ain''t wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no

    Toe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo''


    [Hook: Snoop Dogg]

    Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind

    Many men were eradicated by music minds

    Open ya eyes and take ya time to visualize

    And once ya decide to move ya mind in due time

    It''s so erotic, if it ain''t exotic, it''s gettin naughty

    Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move ya body

    It''s melodic, I''m bein honest and modest

    You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it

    You might also like[Snoop Dogg]

    Fuck that nigga, I''mma do it right

    Thangs ain''t movin right, I don''t think that you would like

    For me to be mad, saying, "Niggas can''t stand me"

    Sittin at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy''s

    Wishin I was there, naw nigga I don''t wish no more

    I''m the big cat, fish in the bowl

    Basically you hear these rappers out here using my flow

    They need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though

    In dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI

    Takin my time, chronolizing my rhyme

    Writing my rhyme, tryin to get intellectual

    Directing the weather, makin my negative records more intellectual

    Tryin to change the direction of flowin

    And sayin, born sayin, "You know I get live-er when I get fluent"

    Ain''t been nobody to change game since King came

    Same thing, same lane, hit it and ya get banged

    Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope

    Thangs don''t change man, it''s so remarkable

    And they don''t know how to do it cause they don''t flow that way

    Go that way, roll that Jay

    Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony

    You''re so into what ya doin but you can''t get into it

    You can''t talk and now ya ruined but y''know I''mma do it

    And now you doin it, they booing like, "You blew it! You blew it!"

    I''m dippin through the universe, make ''em move the verse

    Through the Luda-verse, hit the boota first

    You can never beat a ho, lemme show you how to treat a ho

    If you likin me, follow me, you so believable

    (So...) Got a way to get his own music out

    Record executive, bounce ballin and actin bad

    Take my time, with my.. great mind

    Take ''em out, make mine, kicked about it

    Thanks to niggas who might make it illegal

    And not rival the Beatles, and rock, rockin my peoples

    And fly, fly like eagles been doin the shit like liters

    And hittin y''all with heaters and walkin in my Adidas

  This life: '[Snoop Dogg]

    Some of ''em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block

    That''s how it is for me ''cause I live a boss'' life

    So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay

    Baby this is presidential really

    A pocket full of women understanding how I''m living

    Show them hoes how you winning

    It''s the beginning with the pearls you''re given

    The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon

    But everyday like 50 say, it''s +Many Men+

    They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends

    But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs

    Then the hoes, then the clothes, I''ma have to let ''em go

    You know how the Dogg roll.. don''t get it twisted

    ''Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit

    A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin pimpish

    And it''s comin from the Beach where them niggas is a beast

    But I just listen, all that shit is in my past

    Get back to the episode, sacks full of honey

    Out of this world, [Incomprehensible]

    This is church music, listen to the choir

    To burn my kush, you must use fire

    D-O double G like never heard before

    Smokin'' that bomb like TAC-4

    West Coast worldwide, sea shore to sea shore

    When''s the last time you seen the G in the G4

    (What?)

    Don''t worry, I''ll wait

    Time''s tickin'', I''m trippin'', I''m slippin'', I''ll wait

    Into the zone where these whores on my dog bone

    A dog whistle and they download my ring tone

    And she''s so hypnotized by this pimp''s poem

    What I got here is mine, go and get your own

    I put beats to rhymes, get peace of mind

    OZ''s to dimes and this weed iz mine

    This weed iz mine

    This weed iz mine

    You can''t have it

    I hear niggers talkin'' ''bout what they rollin'' up

    Smell what I smoke ''fore the bag open up

    Good chance if you see me down smokin'' one

    License to get a fundamental load of shit

    Real nigga, blow a reefer, I is old enough

    If I''m in a building, it''s hard not to notice it

    Hit a really sad dog, I got some whores to fuck

    I''mma fall through with the ounce [Incomprehensible] shit

    Don''t trip, bitch, we go all set, load a whole zip

    Let you hit mine, plus you supplyin'' your own little bit

    My nigga get high and let the whores twist

    Say you don''t fuck with [Incomprehensible] how you rolled it

    They ain''t smokin'' like us

    And if it''s found

    Instead tryna ride while the war was at cease


    [Daz Dillinger]

    When me and Snoop was kids we always knew this kid named Tommy

    His parents died left him a gang of cars and money

    But Tommy was a hustler from around the way

    Stayed on the northside of town, is where he stayed

    He payed attention to whatever, they was games so clever

    If the situation was bad it can only get better

    He ran around the dope house

    You might also like[Snoop Dogg (Daz)]

    So he put us up on his scheme

    He knew that we was riders so he wanted us on his team

    (Uh, poor Tommy)

    Getcha money, size team (uh)

    Getcha money man

    (He was out to get paid)

    [Snoop Dogg]

    Tommy was a rider, big money

    Tommy had everything, it wasn''t funny

    All the younger G''s used to look up to him

    But there was no way, that the bigger ones could do him

    They would try him, try him, everytime he was slick

    But he never would slip, he always had his grip

    And if he did, he''d get away cuz he was just too fast

    Homie up Tommy, Tommy, Tommy''s out to mash

    Get it, get it, get it, cuz ya gotta have it

    And when ya get make sure ya grab it and stab it

    Maintain it, brain it, the way ya gots to

    Cuz this is somethin to rock to

    [Daz]

    Man, we stacked up dollars and Caddies

    On missions muggin ''em for him

    We had to gather up cash - whoever owed it to him

    The hitman had hit us, niggas runnin shit

    And never wantin to quit us, when the machine gun spit

    Now we really deep in the game, now it''s murder and drugs

    No names involved when that nigga caught a slug

    Tommy told us forget it, that he''s always down wit us

    The problems of the murder will be aquitted (young nigga)


    [Snoop Dogg]

    Now word on the streets is that Machine Gun Tommy

    Ridin on big ballers for a pasttime hobby

    So if ya havin money, and ya smoke big weed

    A couple of days Tommy was on top of the world

    Threw a party with the homies, invited gangs of girls

  Too Black: '(Intro)

    Do you think it is by accident that everytime

    A black leader appears on the horizon

    With any kind of cleverness, or charisma he''s cut down?

    Malcom, Martin, Leadkur, I want you to arm yourself

    And I''ve asked Josh to be your bodyguard


    All right Dason

    It might be good for Joshua to seal, like he has somethin'' to do

    Make it to see a whole ''nother day, you better

    If you don''t pay attention, and you''ll come up missin''

    I''mma give it to you - live and direct

    Cause I know, a million niggas doin'' bad and they check

    They game every day but they try to find a way

    But somehow, some way, there ain''t no pay (uh)

    It''s the same game, from my town to your town

    From L.A. to Chi-Town, Baghdad (that''s right)

    To the rebel we deliver the true game

    And niggas gettin'' upset cause they can''t maintain (player haters)

    Don''t get mad cause I was blessed with a gift

    To give you people what you need and no more deep shit (that''s right)

    Lit up, get up, sit up, I write it

    Then I, put you all in the mood, you invited

  Too High (Poly High): '[Intro: Big Pimpin]

    Just another day in the motherfucking neighborhood

    A pimp''s waking up and he''s feeling good

    Versace to the flow

    He didn''t even mess with the Taylor made shit today y''all

    Smelling good with his reptiles on for sure


    [Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    I''m waking up in the morning, man I''m mourning; what''s wrong?

    My Nigga Corleone gone in my Zoning, but I''m boning, out to school

    Cause I can''t be late, cause they''ll lock the gate

    And it''s damn near eight, that''s when the bell ring

    I''m a slide on in, and come right on in

    And once I bail through the hallways, giving it up

    Funky fresh stars and khakis, cool living it up

    What up? - the same shit trying get paid and stay strong

    Lunchtime, I make my way to get my grub on

    Ten minutes to one, feeling good like I should for sure

    Fourth period; walk through the door

    I''m wreaking and smelling like endo

    But still the day moves on to 2:44; one minute left to class

    By Warren G, the Twins and Daz

    Nate Dogg finna scoop us up in a blue drop top Brouham

    I hear some bitches from Wilson wanna tag.. along

    And get up, for the get-down

    Word got around about the niggas from the Piddound

    We keep the whores on point, to join on lit

    And keep heat discreet, until the shit jump off

    Well we''re all from the side, so we won''t ask why

    So you best get high!

    See I... took advantage cause I live right next door

    To the funkhouse, dunkhouse with the whole show

    Niggas know how we go; from first ''til four we don''t show

    Lunch and then the last whore

    It''s getting dealt with some melt shit I guess

    We smoke the Stress, cause my quest wasn''t chronic yet

    Little niggas growing up with my dogs

    Cause we pack the hogs, exercise for my balls


    [Verse 3: Trip Locc]

    Stacked bigger than I thought it would be

    Me and the family, working on TV, get paid and fuck their enemy

    Moving on up, like the Jeffersons but quicker

    All we think about is finding ways to get richer

    Hit you like some dodo, got you''re begging for more

    It''s a trip, I''m serving on the solo

    Low blow, I had you feeling me

    I got some C-O-N-V-O for your community


    [Verse 4: Daz Dillinger]

    I''m still in a fast lane state of mind

    Time is impossible, for me to try to find

    I''m out of school on the line

    Hustling here and there, never show no fear

    Hosted it up on a watch, I posted it up with a Glock

    PCH in atlantic, is what you see just don''t panic

    It''s me, Snoop rocks and when my homies get static

    Got a pistol that blasts like a cannon

    Look out for when we form at the wall, nigga where you standing?

    Raise up, realize, street lights magnify

    Life is giving; don''t let it pass you by

    I''m here and there with the bud, conversating with the drink

    Shocked in my own zone, got time to think

    Cause what would I be, if I wasn''t who I am

    Maybe dead or in jail, maybe time''ll never tell

    Approach me wrong and you will get chin checked

    To disrespect my clique, and you will get dealt with

    Uhh.. plain and simple, nevertheless with the best shit available

    Test me now, let me see how brave you are

    I''m scott free, so it''s on like it used to be

    D-O-G-G P-O-U-N-D G-C, for life, two times ''til I die

    Oh why, Oh why, life is a challenge when you die?

    What''s the peak for me, is the cash and the strap

    Since the 2-1-3 days been like that

    [Chorus: X2]

    Now answer me this - did you fuck that bitch or what?


    [Bill Clinton]

    That''s actually, not the first time that question''s been asked; but

    Since, I believe, and I think any person - reasonable person would

    Believe, that that is not covered, in the definition of sexual

    Relations I was given - ahh - I''m not going to answer it except to

    Refer to my statement. I had intimate, contact with her that was

    Inappropriate - I do not believe any of the contacts I had with

    Her violated the definition I was given; therefore I believe I

    Did not, do anything but testify truthfully on these matters

  True To The Game: '[Intro: Snoop Dogg & DJ Glaze]

    What''s up Snoop, you ready?

    Yeah

    Go ahead man

    This for all the playas and the pimps, not for the simps

    You and the pimp getcha boogie on right about now

    Let''s jam


    [Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    From the very first day I was put in it

    I had to tell myself that I was in it to win it

    Puttin'' the mack down at an early age

    Two steps ahead of my peers so switch to the next phase

    Early ''85 tryna clock a grip

    No time for that wick-wack gangbang shit

    I was tryna find a way to get richer

    And if ya ass caught slippin'', Dogg''s gonna getcha

    That''s how it was and that''s how it is

    You think I''m finna change cause I''m in the hip-hop biz

    Ain''t nuthin'' change but the weather and my shoe size

    Livin'' on the streets''ll make a dumb nigga wise

    That''s why I stay one-up on ya

    Everybody think them gangstas is runnin'' California

    Well ya wrong and I''mma show ya

    The game of a G, is what I''m finna throw ya

    If you can handle it, but if ya can''t, give it back

    See this for the true hardened-macks

    The pimps, not the wimps or the simps

    Takin'' bitches out to eat steak and shrimp, dude

    But who ya better do for these nuts

    Chill out and peep out the rest of the cut

    Cause I''m a young playa who''s afraid to change

    I''d rather stay handlin'', be true to the game

    You might also like[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

    Now I ain''t sayin'' I don''t treat a woman right

    There''s certain extent, you better know when to get tight

    But I ain''t the one to preach and teach

    But these trick-ass niggas took the shit outta reach

    Takin'' her out to eat then takin'' her out to shows

    But when it''s time to get the ass, them nuts is frozen

    And you know why my brother?

    Because you let the bitch now that you love her

    And that''s what she''s supposed to do

    Ya payin'' a hoe to keep close to you

    You''d do much better on the boulevard

    You spend all ya money and dick still hard

    You tryna go out like Babyface

    The money was a waste and youse a disgrace

    To the niggas who put the game down so deeply

    Pumpin'' up loud for the niggas that sleep G

    For some reason they don''t hear me though

    And this is the shit that ya gotsta know

    If ya plan on having a woman nowadays

    Because a woman nowadays has got to stay paid

    And simp-ass niggas put dents in the game

    You know who you are, I ain''t gon'' say ya name

    And get a little fame and start conflict

    Cause I''m a young mack daddy havin'' shit

    So you can go and make that change

    But a nigga like Dogg is stayin'' true to the game

    [Bridge: DJ Glaze]

    Yeah, my nigga Snoop Doggy Dogg in the muthafuckin'' house

    DJ Glaze in this muthafucka too, Foesum


    [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]

    Oh man, I think I got too deep on the last verse

    But you know how I am, I really don''t give a fuck

    Cause a bitch is a bitch and a bitch is gonna stay a bitch

    As long as a nigga broke, but when he get rich

    Watch how her attitude changes

    She wanna start comin'' around and then maintainin''

    A grip on you and a grip a on ya grip

    But I ain''t the one to try to trip that trick

    Let''s see, cause I''m loyal to game

    That''s why I always maintain and keep my brain in the right frame

    Just in case that happens

    The way that I live is the way that I''m rappin''

    Don''t be offended because I speaks the truth

    I can''t help it but I''m that OG playa they call Snoop

    Yes, the fly human being, not European

    But I managed to keep singin''

    Cause ya know that I''m a G in any field I put my heart at

    I''m the mack and I''m packin''

    Yeah, and what I was really talkin'' about was this

    It''s somethin'' that''s crucial but not like a diss

    It''s just to the brothas who keep spendin''

    Ain''t nuthin'' wrong with lendin'' but you keep sendin''

    Mo'' money, mo'' money, mo'' money

    But when ya get broke watch how she get funny

    And don''t wanna neva eva wanna show up

    The the words gonna get around thatcha to'' up

    Then who you gonna kick it with?

    You can''t chill with the homies cause they say you a trick

    And ya know tricks are for kids, silly rabbit

    It turns into a habit, now you on bankrupt status

    I ain''t the Pips but I''m damn sure glad it''s not a playa like me in yo'' shoes

    Because I don''t wanna cry about the mack daddy blues

    Now if you upset and wanna throw them thangs

    I suggest for ya best and trust change

    All up in crazy thoughts

    And for my paper, the vapors, is whatcha just caught

    Doggy Dogg feelin'' a lil'' pain

    I''m just a G from the Beach stayin'' true to the game

    [Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]

    I hope I got my point across the way I wanted to

    Sorry my brother, if you feel I fronted you

    But that''s how I am I don''t nuttin'' back

    And that''s the number one rule of bein'' a mack

    Rule two, money first and that''s a must

    All gold-diggin'' hoes tryna creep get crushed

    And the most important thang

    Is to always stay down and be true to the ga'
  Trust Me: '[Verse 1: Suga Free]

    No, uh-uh excuse me wait baby treat yo'' cash

    And remind me when we get home to get goin

    This P is so immaculate

    I rap a bit just to taste

    Puttin'' hair to the snare to the bass

    Love, drugs, and sex

    She likes love, drugs, and sex

    [Verse 3]

    Freak-a-leek, I speak the truth

    I got girls lined up trying to get in the booth

    Original, more like a miracle

    High definition visual, digital, minimal

    But it can be maxed out

    Track meet, more meat blow your back out

    I had to pull the ''lac out

    Cause there was too many of ya''ll to be left out

    I stepped out mackish with the whole package

    Bread with the cabbage, me and a bad bitch

    Or two, make it three

    31 flavors, nigga

    It gets no better than this

    Now, who in the world can get you more wetter than this?

    I''m back to the hangin'' again, bangin'' again

    Nigga, could you sing it again?

    And I think about all the things we been through

    Like arguin'' and fightin'', for example

    You know, the love we have for each other

    It tends to outweigh what we do to one another

    You know, my granddaddy used to always say

    You know, he used to sing it like this

    And one of ''em tried to fuck your shit up (What?)

    Nah cuz, don''t believe that, that''s my nigga for life

    I''m out with the bullshit, I''m in with the real shit

    I''m at the church doing work, spittin'' game from the pulpit

    Now that''s the business, and God as my witness

    LBC, 213, hell yeah, we in this

    [Verse 2]

    I used to have a lot of broads that I don''t fool with

    I used to have a lot of homeboys I ain''t cool with

    A lot of people that a nigga went to school with

    Happy as hell to see the big dog doin'' it

    But wouldn''t none of them believe it though (What?)

    That I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow

    I guess he was right, these are the breaks

    Despite my mistakes and aches, I''m getting cake

    To realize your fate through faith

    ''Cause we all gon'' get that day (For what?)

    To see if our life was straight

    And see if we''ll be able to walk through the pearly gates (Yeah?)

    To see the man upstairs

    End all the speculation

    Them pre-conceived notions got me over-compensatin''

    And for you slow niggas that mean I''ve been concentratin''

    I''m shittin'' on these records while you rappers constipated

    Uhh, it''s get money, fuck haters

    Me and Snoop Dogg is Sir Charles and King David

    With Problem we all ballin'' like the ''09 Lakers

    Yeah, it''s Terrance Martin on the track

    And I''m that young nigga droppin'' crack back-to-back

    My album on the way and I ain''t worried ''bout the stats

    But I could tell you how the streets gon'' react

    They gon'' say

  Usual Suspects: '[Intro: Snoop Dogg]

    Ha, what ya got? (x4)


    [Verse 1: Threat:]

    It get hectic livin'' life as a suspect

    Ferocious out there, wild as a grizzly bear

    Yo girl on a mission tryna jack ol boy for the cash

    Two ski masks, strapped, where the yay at?

    Ain''t nothin'' nice about the criminal life

    Knives and guns and the chains and the teens in gangs

    That done dropped outta school, he too cool

    To read a book, see nook, crooks wind up on the news

    The earth rattle, the over contaminated cattle

    The enemies sail across seas to do battle

    I know, I used to do those, now I''m retired

    I desire not to have my soul burn fire

    Everybody got a nickname and they clique bang

    Rumble you can hear it through the concrete jungle

    I spit it so well cause I see it all day

    Homemade, pushin'' sledge, spittin'' gettin'' that

    Ladies say hey come close, I don''t bite

    I go to class durin'' the day and I work at night

    I go where I want and I do what I like

    I''m pursuin'' doin'' plumbin'', layin'' down pipes (that''s right)

    Please don''t you quit, oh Snoop can''t stop

    I rock non stop when I have that mic

    You couldn''t do what the D.P.G. niggas do

    And you damn sure can''t do what the L.A. zoo do

    Try to stay true and try to get wit this

    Of course I don''t stop, being a west side rider

    Wit no tattoos, that''s how they got you

    I make conversations on rappers CD''s

    And B.G.s and originals listen for the mission

    Behind the wall, raise the shot call

    Aimin'' at the liberty blastin'' artillery

    My mental mind state is to build and create

    And to weed out suckers, cremate motherfuckers

    Mail through, put it down on your whole military

    Pen ink scary like death at 13ths


    [Snoop Dogg:]

    So all you alley cats get your eyes off the trash

    And beware the bow wow cause I''m bitin'' at your ass

    And got you barkin'' at the wrong tree, nigga

    What you watchin'' the clock for?

  Vapors: '[Verse 1]

    Can you feel it, nothing can save ya

    For this is the season of catching the vapors

    And since I got time, what I''m gonna do

    Is tell you how it''s spreading throughout my crew

    Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records

    "Never Leave Me Alone", "Ain''t No Fun", now check it

    Back in the days before Nate Dogg began

    He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam

    The type of female with fly Gucci gear

    She wore a big turkish ?rope? with a weave in her hair

    When they tried to kick it, she''d always fess

    Talking about, "Baby please, you out here serving stress"

    Since he wasn''t no type of big chronic dealer

    The homie Nate Dogg didn''t appeal to her

    But now he wear boots that match with his suits

    And push a Lexus Coupe that''s extra cheap

    And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and

    Be coming round the Pound every single weekend

    To get his beeper number she be begging please

    Dying for the day to eat these


    [Chorus]

    She caught the vapors

    She caught the vapors

    You might also like[Verse 2]

    I got a little cousin that''s kinda plain

    He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang

    A mellow type of fellow that''s laid back

    But back in the days he wasn''t nothing like that

    I remember when he used to scrap every day

    When my auntie would tell him he would never obey

    He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied

    And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside

    Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad

    They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had

    They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster

    Or either in jail, or someone would shank him

    But now he''s grown up to their surprise

    D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide

    Now the same people that didn''t like him as a child

    Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle


    [Chorus]

    They caught the vapors

    They caught the vapors


    [Verse 3]

    I got another homie from tha L-B-C

    Known to y''all as DJ Warren G

    He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse

    {scratching} and all that mess

    I remember when we first started to rock

    He tried to get this job at Calvin''s Record Shop

    He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted

    Said "Sorry Warren G but there''s no help wanted"

    Now my homie Warren still tried

    On and on and on til the like break of dawn

    To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick

    But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped

    Now for the year after Regulate

    Warren G is having papers so my homie''s like straight

    He walked into the same record shop as before

    And the boss be like "Warren, welcome to my store"

    Offering him a job, but nah he don''t want it

    Damn it feels good to see people up on it

    Cause I remember when at first they wasn''t

    Now guess what they caught since he busting

    The vapors

    [Chorus]

    They caught the vapors

    They caught the vapors


    [Verse 4]

    Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg

    I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog

    When I was a teenager I tried to be down

    But since they wasn''t trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound

    I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, "Can I be down champ?"

    They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp

    After getting rejected, I ain''t run off the set

    I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest

    When I used to go to parties, they''d make me wait

    Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight

    I ain''t never love no hoes I was just into my music

    They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi

    But now things switched from West to East

    "Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?

    We used to see Daz back in the day"

    It happens all the time, so brother don''t be amazed


    [Chorus]

    You caught the vapors

  War Wounds: 'Every soldier got a story to tell


    I done been through it all

    Don''t ask the way I shoot ''cause I done shot (uggh)

    Put a tank on my block

    Fiend gone get the scene hot


    Greens and rocks

    Burnin'' flesh

    Have you ever smelled nigga?

    Been tapped up, ready to die from mail niggas


    Straight goin'' to hell

    But livin'' the dirty, dirty

    Havin'' yah mama worry

    That (?)


    Tired of being blast at, but didn''t cast that

    I done asked for my life, and right there was laughed at

    But when I backtracked, (?)

    Blast back


    Told ''em to cast that, take these rounds and add that

    But fact is you don''t fuckin'' choose yo'' wars

    Or be like me muthafucka and do it with two guns

    Got me runnin'' from cops

    The ghetto life be a dime

    Got me carryin'' two Glocks


    My enemies is bad

    Chop limes of grass

    Drive-bys and rags

    And representin'' red and blue flags


    See I got fools from the ghetto

    Like my cousin'' Jimmy wear permanent metals

    My evidence is satus with hoes

    Bloody Polos


    Pullin'' in car do''s

    And cut up Jabos


    [Chorus: x2]

    I''m down the blast for my homies

    And cash for my homies

    Even if I''m old G I''ll be down to ride and die

    If the hood call me

    That''s why I be hustin'' every day

    Could you imagine me with no stash?

    Like a bank with no cash

    Tryin'' drive a car with no gas


    And fuck one day with no tag?

    Shotgun with no class

    Window with no glass

    Or all you girls with no ass


    See I''m a risky rider

    Caliope crawler

    A Down South Hustla

    Plus a head buster from New Orleans


    See I gotta be a paid nigga

    A made nigga

    Be the nigga to bust yo'' shit

    And the nigga the be the grave digga


    See my tattoos reveal some of the shit I done did

    But the move of other niggas that bout it

    Feel the shit I do just tah live

    See I been scared, popped at, and shot at


    But I live an eye for eye

    So the enemies I ain''t forgot that

    [Chorus: x2]

    It''s real, shit''s real check my war wounds

    This here real life, ain''t no fuckin'' cartoons

    I''m the Saudi Arabian death killin'' veteran on the tube

    Either me or you right here


    Come back and hang out in my room

    I done shot my rifle, trained to kill

    Got blood on my fatiques

    Once you in ain''t no turnin'' back


    Lay yo'' ass over seas

    Might as well handle your business

    There''s no overcome to this shit

    Be on yo'' Ps and Qs nigga


    Don''t cry like no bitch

    You see a weak nigga, that''s a beat nigga

    And fuck a stead nigga, that''s a dead nigga

    Tell my mama not to worry bout me why I''m gone


    If I die bitch, box me up and ship me back home

    Bury me in the N.O. with my stripes on my chest

    Tell them muthafuckas that I did my best

    I mean, that''s a big question, right?

    If "if" was a fifth, we''d all be fucked up

    But what I really wanna know is:

    What if?


    [Hook 1: Suga Free]

    (What if?)

    We had a reckless motherfucker

    That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg

    (What if?)

    We never had a nigga like Big P

    From the Southside, nigga goin'' "woof"

    (What if?)

    We never had a real woman

    That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was

    "Don''t think with your dick, boy! Don''t do that!"

    Come on, you know me, man

    I pimp on, I entertain, man

    That''s why I stay inside my [?] lane

    I gotta be careful when I show you stuff

    ''Cause these haters don''t like you if you know too much

    Yo, ow give it up if you like this

    And you prefer the peace

    And won''t get mad if you don''t have no one to fight with

    We pull the cards around a phony

    My sister told me, "Niggas act hard around they homies"

    Because the West don''t need no beef

    We need our [?] and our roaches

    And our Reres and our Monique

    So stay prayed up, armor on, I got it

    What if you talked to that man

    And understood before you shot him?

    The grass is greener on the side I live on

    Doggy Dogg went soft, motherfucker you did wrong

    But why he on peace, If he was a beast he would''ve took off on the south Midwest
    and the east?

    Chill, y''all niggas don''t get it, and you''ll probably never will

    It''s hard to be real

    But it''s easy to kill, that''s probably why I keep my game on the top of the
    hill

    They keep my name on the top of the bill while y''all lost out there, poppin''
    them pills

    You could''ve been with Snoop Dogg, rockin'' the bill, hop in the veele

    For real, I''m out clockin'' the meal

    We the best thing goin'', got the champagne pourin''

    And we put it down, come and do the damn thing goin''

    I''m a self-made millionaire, the boss Big Snoop

    Everything I touch I turn to big loot

    This the ZU gang and we ride with Snoop

    All I know is that I make that shit do what it do


    [Verse 2]

    It''s the early Berg, it''s the grandest anthem

    Good day LA, it''s time to get back at ''em

    Yea, the west coast renaissance

    You could smell it in the air, feel the ambiance

    And on the road to riches and fancy things

    To get a little recognition, be the major bling

    Get the ole 6 range, house on the hill, 40 acres in the dollar dollar bill

    Big heads in my pocket, hoes in the VI

    Mad dough I stack, get scratched like a feline

    Sip on the bottle mack, lick on the matua

    Break it down, twist ''em up like Chicago rock

    To the club, hop off, new Jays

    Fitted to the back like 7 and 5-8''s

    Style)


    Nine in the mornin, feds at my door (my door)

    Lou Cortez creakin cross the hardwood floor (right)

    Dippin thru the alley I made my escape

    Didn''t even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape

    Man with no music but happy he''s free

    Bailin fast as I can bail down 19th Street

    I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand

    Gold on my knuckle, my pistol''s closed in hand

    I''m a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC

    Remotely controlled by the bomb-ity

    But just livin in big city is a serious task

    Didn''t know what the feds wanted, didn''t have time to ask


    (Snoop Doggy Dogg)


    We''re comin with that G shit, that C shit that makin niggas sick

    How does it feel to see a G from your clique?

    Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?)

    Last night''s dice game got my win on

    About a G and a half is what I come with

    But twenty five G''s is what I left with

    *?Teatley?* was the word I heard

    I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the cone

    Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas

    I threw a C (C-I-X) so my point was the biggie

    Seven-four-four-tre back to back

    I sent two fools back to their lizzack

    See now I''m off to the graveyard shift

    And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip

    But I chill cos my ho might call

    Ain''t no thang cos I sleeps all day and slang when night fall

    And I takes a quick walk up the block

    With my Glock cocke, ready to make a stop where I set up shop

    On 59th and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin

    That''s where a nigga''ll be slangin

    I''m makin a cool grip of shit, this ain''t me

    So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki

    And now the shops on deck

    And everything that''s mines I protect with a Tek, I don''t half step

    Now I got ends

    And I''m rollin a Lexus, f**k a Benz, and so many new friends

    But I could only trust a few

    And unawarely I trusted you

    But if only G

    Devoted and quotin, back in ''84

    I was thirteen, G was a year older

    But I still wadn''t afraid to throw him from his shoulders

    Gettin good on the hood was the anticipation

    And yeah, King Park was the destination

    Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night

    Even the smokers that be levellin gettin sparked tonight

    (Lil'' Style)


    Back on the streets, straight blue and grey

    Cos I represent like every day

    Nigga you can''t tell me I don''t be on the spot

    When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot

    From at least about five years ago

    When I was in junior high goin to Marshall

    The homey use to come up to the school and rock

    And leave and have the bitches flockin his jock

    Damn them was the days of the past

    But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin people''s ass

    And everybody a blast

    And if you don''t believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz

    And that''s your ass

    F**ked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha)

    He didn''t even run, he walked away (bust)

    Cos I let it sit that day

    I wished I was there I would''ve clowned

    But that''s why we axed your bitch ass from the Pound

    Cos he wouldn''t even squad back

    Man we can''t f**k with no niggas like that

    He''ll get us all cracked

    If the police was behind us, he wouldn''t even jump out with the strap

    Now that''s what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!)

  Words Are Few: '[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

    Grab a pen, scratch your chin, make the beat

    Maybe not, smokin'' pot on the beach

    Paranoid with my boys, where my keys?

    And my head in the clouds, is that him?

    And my boys trippin'' hard like nigga, chill

    Someone new with the mouthful of boot

    Now my boys, they come in with the deal

    Things ain''t what they seem

    Feeling like I''m fooling me

  Words From Snoop (Spoken Word): '[Snoop Dogg]

    They had been listening to our music and was inspired by what we did and just
    the fact that, ya know Big Pun was covering it and getting at me to be in the
    video, it made me feel good, like a legend before my times


    They did that like nobody else could do that, cause that was one of those classic
    records that was like, if you touch it, you gotta really know what you doing or
    you really mess up the ingredients and they touched it and really put they own
    ingredients on it to make it sound real smoothYou might also lik'

    This one is strictly for the pimps, players, true money makers

    Nothin'' but a players ball right here on W-Balls, pimp fun under the sun

    That''s right, we doin'' it live with Soopafly, Too $horty, and my main man Doggy
    Dogg


    [Verse 1: Soopafly]

    I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever

    Man, Soopafly never ever ever

    Fell for the do-low, and you know I''m

    Too swift on my toes and it gives a pose

    It''s too much for me to be givin'' to you

    Uh, all I''m givin'' is some dick in you

    Now she agreed (Uh), I told the bitch to blaze the weed

    Now she blazed it (Uh), but that ain''t all she blew

    Hey, I got knocked off on the bar

    In my room, got knocked off in the car, uh

    Gave it to me until I reached my peak

    Baby flipped, talkin'' ''bout lovin'' me in the week

    I said, "That''s too damn quick and that''s too damn fast

    You''ve been givin'' up too much cock and givin'' up too much ass

    Nah, nah, nah, you ain''t gettin'' me like that"

    Soopafly ain''t even called the bitch back

    Ever since she tripped I went on one

    Stepped in the club, caught me a home run

    Baby was bad and all, she said, "Give me a call"

    I wanted to break that bitch like a law

    Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth

    Talkin'' ''bout what could pop out and hit the groove

    Then she said somethin'' about the cost

    Man, that same bus stop is where I dropped

    That bitch back the fuck off

    You can''t ride my bird, so I kicked that bitch to the curb

    You best to believe (Uh)

    You ain''t got no trick up your sleeve that can get with your weave

    But Soopafly never ever slips

    (Oh, man, I''m way too cool, girl)

    You thought you had my cash

    Nah, baby (That''s my money!)

    ''Til I turned around and whooped yo'' ass

    Like a pimp, and that''s for real


    [Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]

    I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe, lookin'' too cute

    Tryin'' to get my shoot on, so I''ma scoot on

    Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas (Texas)

    She fly, but she wasn''t the sexiest

    She had a ho with her named ''Bama, short for Alabama

    A big bad mama jama, now look here

    I like big bitches (''Kay), ''cause they large (Uh-huh, uh)

    And big bitches always take charge

    Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg

    ''Cause you like it tall, go and work it, baby doll (Baby doll)

    Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of

    Got a lot of cash for a little love

    All they wanna do is take you down to the mall

    Floss a little bit and get a T-shirt that say "Ms. Snoop Dogg"

    I don''t see a goddamn thang

    That''s stoppin'' you from buyin'' me that goddamn ring

    It''d look nice on my finger, I''ma buy you a zinger

    ''Cause you make me feel like a real hip hop singer

    Your homegirl, bring her, ''cause I''ve been dyin'' to meet her

    You know I won''t cheat her, don''t mistreat her

    She only get the dick, I''ll never ever eat her

    But I''ll drop her ass, ''cause you know I don''t need her

    Shit, it was fun while it lasted

    You know what they say, "Big things come in small packages, baby"

    [Hook: Snoop Dogg]

    You thought you had my grip

    But Snoop Dogg never ever slips

    You thought you had my cash

    Trick biatch


    [Verse 3: Too $hort | Snoop Dogg]

    I said, biatch, what are you smokin''?

    A big fat dick comin'' from East Oakland

    There must be some kind of misunderstandin''

    Hit the parking lot, bitch, I''ll be standin'' by the Benz

    You think a nigga rich, bitch

    Gold diggin'' tramps tryin'' to get with this dick

    For all the wrong reasons

    Niggas ain''t trickin'' durin'' pimp season

    But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway

    If any other nigga picked you up, it''d be payday

    I rolled to my house with the bitch

    What''d you do, $hort? Introduced her mouth to my dick ("How you doin''?")

    Glad to meet ya, make yourself comfortable

    You fuckin'' with a dog, bitch, you ain''t finna come up, ho

    So you might as well enjoy the ride

    And serve this nigga from the Eastside (Eastside)

    Not much for the game that I''m sellin''

    Ain''t no tellin'' like Jack told Helen

    I know sex sells, but I''ma tell you though

    Can''t spend on shit that ain''t valuable

    Fucked all night, woke up the next mornin''

    Told her, "I''m a pimp," but the bitch kept on

    Wantin'' me to do somethin'' for the time she spent (Hahahaha)

    It''s funny, ''cause now she can''t find the rent money
